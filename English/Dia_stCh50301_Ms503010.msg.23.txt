<string>I'm glad you came to speak with me, Hunter.<lf>...Might I make a request of you?
<string>I'd like to commission the capture of some endemic<lf>life as part of the Guild's ecological survey.
<string>Endemic life capture? Understood.
<string>I'm grateful. Allow me to briefly go over the<lf>process, as a quick refresher.
<string>Just equip the capture net to your Slinger, aim,<lf>and fire at the target to retrieve a specimen.
<string>Patience and precision are key.<lf>Please let me know once the task is complete.
<string>Excellent work. I've taken the specimen you<lf>collected into my care.
<string>With that, our survey of the Windward Plains<lf>is complete.
<string>Phew... There's no way I didn't finish first.
<string>...Hm? What do you mean?
<string>Oh, pay me no mind. It's nothing.
<string>Thank you again for your assistance. Here, allow<lf>me to compensate you.
<string>The Tracktail Lizards of the Windward Plains<lf>seem to favor the areas around oases.
<string>For all their adaptations to desert life, I suppose<lf>they do still need water to survive.
