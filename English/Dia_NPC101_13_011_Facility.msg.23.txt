<string>Good hunter, I've learned that the fire in one's<lf>heart is not something to be restrained.
<string>Let it burn, surging ever upward...
<string>I would love to show the young'uns here some<lf>of your exotic possessions, to broaden their world.
<string>It would please me greatly if you would<lf>join me in barter. As time permits, of course.
<string>Come again soon.
<string>You have my thanks.
<string>Until next time.
<string>Come by whenever you like.
<string>If something should catch your eye...
