<string>I saw you regarding our gemchimes with<lf>a curious gaze.
<string>With each movement, the gemchimes chip away<lf>until they return to the sands completely.
<string>They share the fate of us Sandfolk, in that.
<string>Apologies if the odor disturbs you, traveler.<lf>I was making medicine.
<string>When I was a girl, we found comfort in this aroma.<lf>Children these days are a bit fussier, though...
<string>The gemchimes are a treasured ward. We harvest<lf>the stone, transport it, protect and sculpt it.
<string>Many hands play a part in that long process.<lf>All to protect life here.
<string>Joy is never far from reach, if you seek it. It is<lf>dangerous to leave the village during the Fallow.
<string>But even here, we find joy in our work through<lf>stories and song.
<string>The Fallows' end always brings the Sandtide.<lf>We must ready for the storm.
<string>The children love stories. Tales from times<lf>long past.
<string>Whenever I tell them, I wonder to myself just who<lf>I might have been, were I alive back then...
<string>When the Plenty comes, everyone begins to buzz<lf>about. But do not get swept up in their busy ways.
<string>Young or old, we all have but one body. Rest.<lf>Prepare. These things are important, too.
<string>The people here all have their grievances.<lf>At times, they come to share them with me.
<string>In those moments, I offer them these words: after<lf>the Sandtide comes the Plenty. This too will pass.
<string>Fine weather today. Stay, I will tell the tale<lf>of the great bird Somult before you go.
<string>Mm? No interest? Children always love<lf>this story, but suit yourself.
<string>From what Zatoh tells me, you are quite the<lf>formidable Seikret rider.
<string>The boy is stern as the summer's sun. He has<lf>no qualms chastising even myself.
<string>I suppose you gave him no room to complain, eh?<lf>Hoh ho ho.
<string>You all should return once your business is done.
<string>Do not let the Sandtide find you<lf>wandering about outside.
<string>You would be beyond our help, I fear. It is too<lf>dangerous for us to be out in it.
<string>Zatoh, you say? He should be escorting the<lf>water bearers.
<string>If you wish to visit the oasis, think twice.<lf>Sand leviathans frequent it as much as humans.
<string>We live to greet another time of Plenty, together.<lf>As village chief, I could not be more grateful.
<string>To imagine a Doshaguma would enter the village.
<string>We must think of new measures to protect Kunafa.
<string>Why has the Sandtide come so early? We've never<lf>seen the natural cycle disrupted before.
<string>What ill does this augur...?
<string>We once again beckon in the joyful season<lf>of trade with Azuz.
<string>Kunafa's cheese is a delicacy there.<lf>Have you had a taste yet?
<string>How is young Nata faring? Such a difficult journey<lf>must be so frightening at his age...
<string>Please tell him that he always has a home<lf>in Kunafa.
<string>Welcome, welcome. My apologies that we<lf>cannot offer more to you.
<string>The others wish to express their gratitude, as well.<lf>Take your time to rest.
<string>Have you noticed? The anxious haze hovering<lf>over our village.
<string>We could all benefit from some reassurance.
<string>Zatoh and Y'sai gave their all to protect this<lf>village. You are of a different caliber, though.
<string>On behalf of Kunafa, Windsong Village, I offer you<lf>our deepest gratitude for your assistance.
<string>We are forever in your debt.
<string>Have there been any changes, ma'am?
<string>When is there not change? The wind blows and<lf>the dunes shift.
<string>We continue to live here amid those changes.
<string>I have lived a long life, traveler.
<string>But until recently, I had never considered learning<lf>more about the monsters that live alongside us.
<string>But perhaps that is why I've lived long enough<lf>to meet you all, hm?
<string>Nona talks about you all the time.
<string>Particularly about the day you rode in to save her.
<string>You're like something out of the tales we tell.
