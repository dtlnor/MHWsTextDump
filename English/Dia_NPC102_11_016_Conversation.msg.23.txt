<string>I saw you regarding our gemchimes with<lf>a curious gaze.
<string>With each movement, the chimes chip away until<lf>they return to the sands completely.
<string>They share the fate of us sandfolk, in that.
<string>Apologies if the odor disturbs you, traveler.<lf>I was making medicine.
<string>When I was a girl, we found comfort in this aroma.<lf>Children these days are a bit fussier, though...
<string>The gemchimes are a treasured ward. We harvest<lf>the stone, transport it, protect and sculpt it.
<string>Many hands play a part in that long process.<lf>All to protect life here.
<string>Joy is never far from reach, if you seek it. It is<lf>dangerous to leave the village during the Fallow.
<string>But even here, we find joy in our work through<lf>stories and song.
<string>The Fallows' end always brings the Sandtide.<lf>We must ready for the storm.
<string>The children love stories. Tales from times<lf>long past.
<string>Whenever I tell them, I wonder to myself just who<lf>I might have been, were I alive back then...
<string>When the Plenty comes, everyone begins to buzz<lf>about. But do not get swept up in their busy ways.
<string>Young or old, we all have but one body. Rest.<lf>Prepare. These things are important, too.
<string>The people here all have their grievances.<lf>At times, they come to share them with me.
<string>In those moments, I offer them these words: after<lf>the Sandtide comes the Plenty. This too will pass.
<string>Fine weather today. Stay, I will tell the tale<lf>of the great bird Somult before you go.
<string>Mm? No interest? Children always love this<lf>story but suit yourself.
