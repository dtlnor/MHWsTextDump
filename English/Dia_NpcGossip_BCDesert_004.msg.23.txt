<string>Black Windrustlers are clearly distinct from their<lf>standard cousins. In size, not just in color...
<string>I'm curious if the two traits are linked. Which<lf>came first: the melanism, or gigantism?
<string>If an individual exhibiting just one of the two<lf>were found, we'd have an answer, but no such luck.
<string>It's clearly a relative of the Amstrigian, but its<lf>song is quite different. It's beautiful.
<string>I suppose it's inevitable that its vocal apparatus<lf>evolved for mating or territory-marking purposes.
<string>Adaptations of this sort always strike me as a<lf>sign of animals putting in effort.
<string>That blue is almost blinding... There's no mistaking<lf>it for a normal Ember Rufflizard.
<string>The bobbing of their frill makes them look like a<lf>ball of azure flame floating on the lava fields.
<string>I would love to observe them in their habitat,<lf>but it's not the sort of place we can easily visit.
<string>All the more reason I'm grateful to you for<lf>bringing this specimen here, Hunter.
<string>That golden sheen is the undeniable mark of a king.<lf>Always fills me with childlike wonder to see.
<string>But what sort of evolutionary path<lf>led to that pigmentation...?
<string>The leading theory claims it's camouflage, meant<lf>to mimic tree sap.
<string>...But the sap in the Scarlet Forest is red.
<string>So there must be some other reason. <lf>I do love a good mystery.
<string>If the Gold Hercudrome is the king of insects, the<lf>Prism Hercudrome feels like his queen.
<string>It's like a living gemstone... I'll just get lost<lf>in admiring it. No wonder collectors adore them.
<string>But that high demand means few circulate to us<lf>researchers. Just another debt I owe you, Hunter.
<string>A Regal Jewel Scarab...it's every bit as flamboyant<lf>as the name suggests. Like an exquisite gem brooch.
<string>You don't see the like of its carapace in any other<lf>species. Perhaps it's unique to this region...
<string>A consequence of the sap found<lf>in the Scarlet Forest, perhaps?
<string>Hmm, it's certainly a possibility to explore.
<string>Such an extravagant shell. Topped with glimmering<lf>ornamentation, no less... Certainly a flashy fellow.
<string>I couldn't begin to say why it walks around<lf>wearing manmade objects...
<string>Perhaps it's simply aesthetic preference?<lf>Maybe it enjoys sparkles.
<string>Hrmmm, I just don't know...
<string>That plumage is stunning... Does such an<lf>ostentatious display not attract predators?
<string>Its molting season seems to align with the Plenty,<lf>so they may mate during a relatively safe period.
<string>Choosing their moment, balancing survival and<lf>reproduction needs... Fascinating.
<string>Bioluminescent body, highly developed ears and<lf>legs... A curiously <ITALIC>distinct</ITALIC> creature, isn't it?
<string>What significance does its pale glow hold, I wonder?
<string>One theory claims intimidation, another to blind<lf>predators. Yet another, intra-species communication.
<string>Conversing through the blinking of a shooting<lf>star... How romantic.
<string>I was observing the Gillopod earlier, but it<lf>moved so little that I fell asleep.
<string>Torpor in animals is frequently a way of limiting<lf>energy expenditure in times of scarcity...
<string>But if anything, nutrients are <ITALIC>too</ITALIC> plentiful there.<lf>What do you make of the degeneration of their eyes?
<string>Simplest case...they have no need<lf>to search for food?
<string>The Downy Crake are avian phantoms... Once they<lf>decide to run, nothing catches them.
<string>I never imagined I would see one<lf>firsthand during my lifetime.
<string><ITALIC>I</ITALIC> never imagined I'd see our<lf>master shriek like that.
<string>...That may be rarer than any living creature.
<string>It's thought that uncovering the Petricanths'<lf>ecology is the key to unlocking all of paleontology.
<string>A bit overblown, as claims go, but... I agree, the<lf>value of studying Petricanths can't be overstated.
<string>Existing today, just as it did eons ago... It's<lf>practically a form of time travel.
<string>The underside of an Escunite's tentacles bear organs<lf>called funnels, primarily used for locomotion.
<string>I suppose they need the extra help, given how<lf>hard and weighty their shells are.
<string>Every adaptation that can assist in propelling<lf>that hefty frame counts. Makes perfect sense.
<string>A pure-white Escunite. It's beautiful. How it<lf>sparkles in the light...
<string>Is it adaptive camouflage, or just a random mutation?<lf>Escunite are so rare, they remain largely a mystery.
<string>A mystery we now have the privilege of puzzling<lf>apart. We owe you a tremendous debt, Hunter.
