<string>We got a message from Erik. He said something<lf>in the Scarlet Forest caught his attention.
<string>Shall we go and hear what he has to say?
<string>Is there nothing you can do? Surely you people<lf>know of something!
<string>Red wyvern danger, big danger.
<string>Mhm, mhm. I see.
<string>Oh, thank goodness you're here.
<string>All of these people come bringing alarming reports<lf>of Rathalos activity.
<string>Olivia's tied up on another investigation.<lf>I'd love it if you could take a look. Do you mind?
<string>What's up?
<string>I'll check in a bit later.
<string>Right, yes. I'll just...be here collecting these<lf>reports. Come by when you can.
<string>I have a proposal, if that's all right.
<string>Erik has already been gathering intel and has<lf>an understanding of the situation.
<string>Why not have him serve as handler for this<lf>investigation? If you're amenable, that is.
<string>True, that might expedite things a bit.
<string>Alright, let's do it.
<string>I've already told you! This red wyvern issue<lf>is a life-or-death matter!
<string>It's been hounding our poor livestock around the<lf>clock. At this rate, someone's going to get hurt.
<string>Red wyvern. Big, BIG an-gurr-y.<lf>My tail is toasty-burnt.
<string>You lot have weppons. Use weppons. Fix problem.
<string>I hear your concerns, and understand them.
<string>But now I have a question for you. Has this ever<lf>happened here before?
<string>Why would this red wyvern start making trouble now?<lf>Aren't you curious to find out?
<string>Monsters just act on instinct, don't they?<lf>What's the use in asking why?
<string>That's not true, though! They're living creatures–<lf>the same as you or me!
<string>There's always a reason for their actions.<lf>Just like you all had reasons for coming here today.
<string>Erik is right. Which is why we intend<lf>to investigate the cause.
<string>Well, I guess if you think that's best.
<string>Red wyvern, close to our home. Maybe still near.
<string>Thank you for the tip. Alright, let's begin<lf>the investigation.
<string>It sounded like you wanted them to understand<lf>monsters better, Erik.
<string>Well, sure. I guess I do.
<string>...This probably isn't much of a surprise, but I've<lf>never been great at relating to other people.
<string>One time, Werner found me feeling low and told me,<lf>"People are living creatures too, right? That's your field."
<string>Ever since, I've started to believe that I was<lf>born human for a reason.
<string>Learning is about opening a new door and walking<lf>through it. I don't want anyone to give up on that.
<string>There. Rathalos tracks.
<string>Let's have a look.
<string>These are claw marks.
<string>Still fresh.
<string>These markings are to make its presence here known...<lf>Proof of a strong territorial nature.
<string>Let's keep moving. The tracks continue ahead.
<string>That looks like...
<string>Something's different. Let's take a look.
<string>These are... Rathalos scorch marks.
<string>It must have been quite agitated. Fighting with<lf>some other creature, perhaps?
<string>No Rathalos I've ever seen left marks like this.
<string>An electrical burn. But there shouldn't be any<lf>monsters here with thunder properties.
<string>Over here! Quickly!
<string>Our mission here is to capture it alive.<lf>Let's be careful!
<string>Let's baggy that Lagi!
<string>It's mantled with energy!<lf>Watch out for thunder attacks!
<string>It's entered an enhanced charged state!<lf>Exercise extreme caution!
<string>It's attacking from the water! Be careful!
<string>It's targeting you from the water!<lf>Stay on your toes!
<string>Up ahead... This must be its nest.
<string>This is bad, it's readying a powerful<lf>discharge attack!
<string>Have to get in the water and attack<lf>to stop it!
<string>I'll keep the status reports from on land coming!
<string>Alright, let's dive in!
<string>OK! Commencing aquatic combat!
<string>Fully charged state confirmed!
<string>It's storing up electricity! Hurry and attack!
<string>Make use of the environment in the water!<lf>Try to get creative!
<string>It's readying something terrifying.<lf>Dodge as quickly as possible!
<string>Unreal... You actually stopped it!
<string>Heap the pressure on!
<string>Lagiacrus is still powerfully charged!<lf>Don't let your guard down!
<string>A Lagiacrus! I mean, I've heard the name before.<lf>Who'da thought we'd see one in the forest, though!
<string>Crazy stuff... If my old friend heard, I'm sure she'd<lf>push her glasses up and come running.
<string>Erik is incredibly tenacious when it<lf>comes to "knowing" things.
<string>Long ago, Professor Fabius said he also shows an<lf>incredible tenacity for wanting things to "be known."
<string>He said it was both a strength—and a naivety...
<string>Erik is really passionate about the world and<lf>its creatures. He's been teaching me a lot.
<string>Any living thing I ask him about, he tells me<lf>everything there is to know about it with a smile.
<string>Are you all right!? Those thunder attacks<lf>are certainly legendary for a reason...
<string>You may be able to disrupt its charge if you focus<lf>your attacks on the dermal spikes on its back.
<string>You should be able to grapple onto Lagiacrus with<lf>your Hook Slinger.
<string>That may be your best bet to avoid getting caught<lf>up in its underwater attacks.
<string>You really managed to capture a Lagiacrus...<lf>You're unbelievable!
<string>Now it's my turn to get to work. I'll have this<lf>amazing specimen studied ASAP.
<string>...So the reason the red wyvern was agitated is<lf>because of another monster called Lagiacrus.
<string>As for that one, it appears to have migrated<lf>in from far outside the region.
<string>You're able to tell that much?
<string>Yes, from trace substances on its body and<lf>the growth and wear on its dermal spikes.
<string>As for why it's here, I suspect it was drawn<lf>to the ample prey in this nutrient-rich environment.
<string>Huh. I'd never stopped to think about monsters<lf>like that. Just went with what I was taught.
<string>Guess they pick fights and get bent out<lf>of shape, too.
<string>We'll transport the Lagiacrus back to its original<lf>habitat, but this could happen again.
<string>Let's plan how to handle things from now<lf>on together. The red wyvern, too.
<string>Hey, uh... I'm sorry, yeah? For coming and<lf>demanding you fix our problems.
<string>We really appreciate it. I definitely wouldn't<lf>have thought of capturing it.
<string>Big, big thankings!
<string>Great work, everyone.
<string>Thanks, Alma. I think this is another case closed.
<string>...Hey. Can I talk to you?
<string>What you said before, you sounded just like<lf>Olivia. It really meant a lot.
<string>Would you mind if I helped out Avis Unit<lf>as a handler on your investigations again?
<string>I'm fascinated to find out what sort of path<lf>you choose to walk.
<string>Really? It would certainly be helpful to broaden<lf>our range of expertise. I, for one, am all for it.
<string>Welcome aboard!
<string>What about your unit?
<string>Sure, welcome aboard.
<string>Really? Thanks!
<string>It's our pleasure!
<string>Well then, just let me know whenever<lf>you need my help.
<string>Olivia and Werner? Well...
<string>They'd probably grill up a feast to mark the occasion<lf>and tease me about finally making new friends.
<string>Werner would...indulge himself, sleep for three days,<lf>and Olivia would wake him up via water bucket.
<string>Then I guess we don't need to worry.<lf>Looking forward to working with you.
<string>I appreciate the help too, Erik.
<string>Wonderful! Well then, just let me know<lf>whenever you need my help.
