<string>I simply must find those endangered eggs!
<string>What's wrong? Missing person? Missing egg? Which is it?
<string>Azuria? Royal? What?
<string>Thank goodness you're here, <PLNAME>!<lf>Please talk to this Felyne!
<string>He keeps talking about eggs and duties,<lf>and it's too hard to follow.
<string>Salutations. Where did you come from?
<string>Meow?!
<string>You...don't look like you're part of our expedition.
<string>Indeed. From your accoutrements, I can only<lf>surmise you are with the Hunters Guild.
<string>I am Rudy, a Royal Palico in service to the kingdom of Azuria.
<string>And what brings an...is it "Azurian" Royal Felyne?<lf>To a place like this?
<string>As it happens, I was in the midst of a crucial<lf>mission to deliver monster eggs.
<string>However, I seem to have taken a wrong turn<lf>and wound up here.
<string>Adding insult to injury, a monster found me<lf>and caused me to drop my precious ovoid parcel.
<string>Oh, hang it all! To drop the eggs <lf>of an endangered species!
<string>No—I must blubber no further.<lf>New eggs must be found. Farewell!
<string>Not so fast furriend! You won't be able to<lf>find eggs in a place you barely know!
<string>We could help find and deliver those eggs, right?
<string>Egg conveyance is one of my many fortés.
<string>Well, that is highly encouraging!<lf>What a truly gracious offer!
<string>I've set up the egg delivery as an Optional Quest.<lf>Now, let us begin the search for that egg!
<string>I'll be joining you for this quest.
<string>So this is the egg of that endangered species.<lf>It looks quite unusual.
<string>I wonder if it tastes unusual.
<string>Don't even—! This is not food, Hunter!
<string>Rudy is going to be so pleased.
<string>Egg conveyance is one of our many fortés!
<string>Nothing puts your skills to the test quite like<lf>hauling an egg from Point A to Point B.
<string>There's a monster nearby. Tread carefully.
<string>The monster is after you!
<string>You're going to run out of breath!
<string>Take a moment to catch your breath.
<string>The delivery site is just a little further.
<string>Is that camp, or is it paradise?
<string>That's it! That's one of the eggs! Oh, thank you!
<string>I can see you are possessed with great<lf>talent and ability, Hunter.
<string>Enough to make any Ranger's jaw drop.<lf>Truly impressive!
<string>Impeccably executed! You must teach me<lf>how you do it!
<string>You've the makings of a Ranger,<lf>if I may be so bold!
<string>Hunter, are you all right?
<string>Whew, what a challenge!<lf>A truly eggs-istential crisis!
<string>Your assistance is truly a boon, Hunter!
<string>A royal Felyne... Wow...
<string>Where, oh where is Azuria...?
<string>Thank you all so much for your help!<lf>Now I can carry out my Rangerly duties!
<string>Might I ask what it is you Rangers do?
<string>Of course! Rangers bond with monsters<lf>and coexist with them.
<string>Coexist with monsters? Wow!
<string>We fight alongside our Monsties against<lf>monsters that threaten their ecosystems.
<string>But most of all...
<string>Most of all? This next part sounds important.
<string>Very! We protect endangered monster species<lf>and help reacclimate them to the wild.
<string>We are constantly pushing the boundaries<lf>of human-monster coexistence!
<string>And my master is not just any Ranger—<lf>but the group's captain at that!
<string>However, we find ourselves faced <lf>with a new problem...
<string>The environment surrounding our habitat<lf>is gradually turning to crystal.
<string>What? But why?
<string>I...don't know. But we are at risk of losing our home.
<string>That's why the Rangers are working doubly<lf>hard right now—to reclaim our environment!
<string>But listen to me, prattling on! I must return to<lf>Azuria and bring these tidings to my master!
<string>I hope we meet again some day.<lf>May Azuria find its well-deserved peace.
<string>Farewell, and blessings to you all,<lf>my friends from the Hunters Guild!
