<string>Livvie holds high ideals. I won't be the one<lf>to drag her down with laziness.
<string>Greetings, good Hunter of Avis Unit.
<string>These Seikret and I will get along nicely.
<string>Hunter of Avis Unit. Is something wrong?
<string>I may not always voice them, but I have my own<lf>opinions, just like you and Livvie.
<string>When I feel overwhelmed by circumstances,<lf>I make a point to look up at the sky.
<string>What else can you do, sometimes?
<string>With every new land comes new troubles...
<string>Where did the rain <ITALIC>come</ITALIC> from?
<string>And the large, oddly-shaped tree?<lf>Surely that caught your attention.
<string>Be careful.
<string>Ah. How are you?
<string>Ah. How are you?
<string>We've come far together, friend.
<string>Hm. Nata's homeland...
<string>Hmm.
<string>Together, we will overcome this.
<string>What grand times we've had together.
<string>Times like these make you realize just how<lf>small you are in the grand scheme of things...
<string>Why turn to me? You already have<lf>your answer, don't you?
<string>My whiskers are tingling.
<string>Here to see Livvie?
<string>Here to see <ITALIC>me?</ITALIC> Hmm. Did...we have anything in<lf>common to talk about?
<string>Livvie is a given, but by this point I've known<lf>Werner and Erik for quite awhile as well.
<string>None of them have changed a bit.
<string>I often eat my meals with Werner.
<string>He constantly forgets to eat, so I have to keep an<lf>eye on him, you see.
<string>There are no absolute "right answers" in this world.
<string>So, personally, I think you've made a fine choice.
<string>Tempered monsters have appeared here as well, then...
<string>Though, if individuals that strong were to exist<lf>anywhere, it would be a place as unique as this.
<string>I plan to bury my bones wherever Livvie winds up.
<string>What about you?
<string>Livvie was calling for you.
<string>Such tremendous energy. Can feel it in my bones.
<string>Curious folk, those Lynians. The Wudwuds.
<string>Seems they think the same of me.
<string>Leave things here to us.
<string>Not confident we have things under control?
<string>Fabius... Quite an elegant man.
<string>So we're up against Gore Magala.
<string>Fur coat or no fur coat, cold is cold...
<string>Must have been even colder for you furless folk.<lf>Impressed you could bear it.
<string>I don't wish to see Nata's expression darkened...
<string>Fond of this place. Enough to surprise myself.
<string>When this mission's done, it's just on to the next.
<string>Same for you, I'd wager. That's what we are.
<string>Nata smiles more, lately... I'm glad to see it.<lf>Truly.
<string>I'm far-flung from home... But not afraid.
