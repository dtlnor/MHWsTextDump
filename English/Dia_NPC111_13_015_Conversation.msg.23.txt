<string>Hey there, Hunter! Welcome to Azuz!
<string>Eat a lot, sleep a lot, play a lot. What's better<lf>than that?
<string>Don't worry, me and Maki are done pulling crazy<lf>stunts. You can relax. ...For now.
<string>It's finally time for my auric oil to see the<lf>light of day!
<string>Be sure to enjoy the festival<lf>before you go, Hunter!
<string>Looking back now, it almost feels<lf>a little nostalgic.
<string>The day my boring, repetitive life went up in<lf>a glorious blaze in the blink of an eye...
<string>Cause I'm kind of a dummy, yeah? I forget that<lf>you only get to look back fondly if you <ITALIC>survived.</ITALIC>
<string>Whew, you really pulled us out of the fire<lf>this time!
<string>Thanks... You're all right, friend!
<string>We got all that auric oil, and now this... Talk<lf>about a kick in the teeth.
<string>Maybe I'll just go take a nap.
<string>This is all just a dream! Right? It's gotta be!
<string>Makiii... Booossss...! I'm so-ho-ho glaaad...!
<string>Just thinking about it, I... I can't stop...<lf>Bawww-ha-haa...!
<string>Maki's got a spark in her eye as bright as<lf>the Everforge!
<string>Nroooaaaaagh! I've gotta get on her level!
<string>All our auric oil, going to waste <ITALIC>again?</ITALIC>
<string>If this was gonna happen, I should've slacked off<lf>a little. ...What? OK, fine, sorry!
<string>Wait, wait, hold up. What's going on? Does anybody<lf>know!?
<string>...Welp, may as well laugh it off! Hah hah hah!
<string>Ahh, I don't get what's happening! Just work out,<lf>already!
<string>The Black Flame, again? Come <ITALIC>on,</ITALIC> man! Give us a<lf>break here!
<string>Hey, look at it this way: our festival's so hot,<lf>it even makes the monsters come running!
<string>It's fine. Whatever. I'm calling it fine.
<string>I'm s-so glaaad... For awhile there, I was so...<lf>so... Bawww-ha-haa...!
<string>The Oilfolk'll be all right, long as I'm around!
<string>Mm? Where's my confidence come from? HAH,<lf>good one!
<string>I may not understand it all, but I do get that<lf>you're some kinda beast, Hunter!
<string>I bet you've done your share of eating, sleeping,<lf>and playing around, too, huh!?
