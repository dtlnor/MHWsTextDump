<string>Hey, hey! I have another cool idea, wanna hear it?
<string>Sure, what have you got?
<string>So, the Vigorwasps are nice for healing and all,<lf>but are useless if you're knocked out, right?
<string>Well, yeah. Can't do much if I'm laid out flat.
<string>That's what got me thinking. There's a bug that<lf>heals like a Vigorwasp, but like...bigger, yeah?
<string>...A Giant Vigorwasp?
<string>Yeah! Those!
<string>Alright, I'll go catch you one.
<string>Thanks a bunch! Heh heh, I can't wait to get to<lf>work on this one...
<string>Perfect again! Thanks for catching this, partner.
<string>I'm happy to help out.
<string>Wow, Giant Vigorwasps sure are powerful!<lf>They're even better than I thought!
<string>Now I can lend you a paw when you can't stand up!
<string>Thanks, that'll be a huge help.
<string>We'll be ready even if we run into stronger monsters!
<string>Don't be afraid to go all out!
<string>I'll be counting on you.
<string>Woo hoo! Now I can help you out even more!<lf>Let me check it out back at camp, OK?
