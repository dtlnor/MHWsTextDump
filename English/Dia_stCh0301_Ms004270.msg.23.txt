<string>Alright, good, everyone's here. Let's begin.
<string>Some time has passed since we entered the Forbidden<lf>Lands. We should review what we've learned.
<string>Good idea.
<string>What is the relation between the weather and Wylk?
<string>Where is the White Wraith now?
<string>(End Council)
<string>The weather follows a pattern of seasons. Fallow,<lf>then Inclemency, and finally a season of Plenty.
<string>These events occur in a cyclical rhythm.
<string>Right, and the rhythm is most likely controlled<lf>by the energy flowing through the Landspine.
<string>That energy is called Wylk, and it's a part<lf>of everyday life across these lands.
<string>Makes you want to know where it comes from,<lf>doesn't it?
<string>We followed the Landspine down under the Basin,<lf>but it seemed to continue on past the Iceshard Cliffs.
<string>Then we need to investigate the far side.
<string>The White Wraith appeared during the Downpour<lf>and the Sandtide.
<string>Which lends strong evidence that it's feeding on<lf>the elemental energy those Inclemencies produce.
<string>But isn't it strange, then, that it didn't appear<lf>during the Firespring?
<string>Indeed! Why didn't it?
<string>Perhaps it already has all the elemental energy<lf>it needs?
<string>Seeing as there've been no further sightings,<lf>it'll be hell picking up its trail again.
<string>I suggest our unit looks for a way to pass<lf>beyond the Iceshard Cliffs.
<string>Then I have good news for you. Remember the thick<lf>ice blocking the passageway?
<string>I have confirmation that the Black Flame<lf>seems to have melted it away.
<string>The path that leads to my village?
<string>That IS fortunate. You can investigate the Landspine<lf>and the Keepers. Two birds with one stone.
<string>Then that's our objective.
<string>Astrum Unit will set up a Base Camp at the Iceshard<lf>Cliffs to further our research.
<string>Now, we all know what to do. Let's get to it!
<string>This Doshaguma is acting strange.
<string>Something's leaking from its wound...<lf>That's the place to attack!
<string>Its wounds are regenerating?<lf>I need to destroy them before they fully heal.
<string>Crystals formed in the pools of Wylk...<lf>Did its attack create them?
<string>It absorbed the Wylk? Does that replenish<lf>its energy?
<string>This was where the obstruction was.
<string>Look!
<string>Let's go find your village, Nata.
<string>I can finally go home... This way, everyone!
<string>This is definitely the right way.
<string>I can't wait to see everyone... <lf>and Uncle Tasheen!
<string>Did you really walk this whole way by yourself?<lf>That's incredible, Nata.
<string>You're very brave!
<string>Thanks to Nata, our two worlds have been connected.<lf>We WILL find his people.
<string>That's right. Lead the way, Nata!
<string>OK!
<string>It's completely different here.
<string>I don't remember all these roots...
<string>I dropped a glove! It must be here somewhere...
<string>What the heck is that thing? It's nothing like any<lf>monster we know about.
<string>If ever there was a time to prep well, Hunter,<lf>it's now.
<string>I figure these puddles lyin' around have gotta be<lf>Wylk, right?
<string>I'm not a fan of that. One solid hit of monster<lf>breath, and <ITALIC>kaboom...</ITALIC>
<string>No reason to rush, now. The Keepers' village is<lf>right in front of us.
<string>What matters now is just making it back safe,<lf>same as always, yeah?
<string>The Doshaguma's arm gave off a blueish light just<lf>before the blast occurred.
<string>Then some kind of crystal formed in its wake. Do<lf>you suppose they could be crystalline Wylk?
<string>There are cases in nature of albinism in animals,<lf>but that Doshaguma seemed to be something different.
<string>Why, then, is such a monster living near the<lf>Keepers' village?
<string>It's possible there are other monsters here<lf>besides the white Doshaguma.
<string>We had best stay on our guard.
<string>A white monster... White...
<string>I've never seen any monster <lf>like that before. I promise.
<string>But I almost never went outside<lf>the village, either...
<string>Why is there a monster like that,<lf>here? What even <ITALIC>is</ITALIC> it...?
<string>A monster like that, prowling the place... Uncle<lf>Tasheen... Everyone...!
<string>Are we sure that it's actually a Doshaguma?
<string>Use this opportunity to better prepare.
<string>So, what's the story?
<string>It's definitely a Doshaguma. But at the same time,<lf>it might not be.
<string>It seems to lack reproductive organs, and its stomach<lf>and esophagus have atrophied.
<string>Earlier it seemed like it was absorbing energy.
<string>Almost as if it was trying to replenish its power.
<string>Hold on. Doesn't that sort of remind you<lf>of the White Wraith?
<string>It's all speculation, but right now we shouldn't be<lf>out here in the open. Let's continue on to the village.
<string>Let's keep moving, Hunter.<lf>I'll be here, when you're ready.
<string><COLOR FF0000>#Rejected#</COLOR> Dia_stCh0301_Ms004270_0200_t0020
<string>After its forelimbs flash, it releases a shockwave.<lf>Is it storing up some kind of energy?
<string>Let's go find the others. I don't know what<lf>got into that thing...
