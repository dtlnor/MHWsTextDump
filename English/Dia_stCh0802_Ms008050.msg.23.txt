<string>Nata mentioned that something came up<lf>in the data he's been compiling for me.
<string>He's at the Base Camp in Azuz.<lf>Let's head there now.
<string>Alright.
<string>You heard through Alma, Hunter? Thank you.
<string>Can we save the details until we get to Azuz?<lf>I'd like to discuss this with everyone.
<string>Alright, we can speak there.
<string>Hey, um, thanks for coming.
<string>Mr. Satesh said something was strange<lf>down below. On the path to Sild, I mean.
<string>Where the Wyrmway was? Alright,<lf>I'll get the full story from him.
<string>Alright. I'll go and call him, then.
<string>So I hear something unusual is going on underground?
<string>Yes. The deeper you go, the cooler it gets.<lf>Strange, no? So, I went down further...
<string>And it went from cool to cold. Unnaturally cold.<lf>It was quite unsettling, so...I turned back.
<string>What in blazes is going on down there? I figured<lf>you people might know something.
<string>I see. That definitely qualifies as an anomaly.<lf>Let's head down and have a look.
<string>OK. Let's go.
<string>Whoa. Something this big can freeze solid...?

<string>If it's cold enough here for this to happen...
<string>Right. Reports from Base Camp on the other side<lf>say the blizzard there shows no signs of letting up.
<string>Details remain unclear, but Jin Dahaad has been<lf>observed in a dangerously agitated state.
<string>So, is that what's causing this?
<string>Maybe. The dominant monster in<lf>each region has evolved...
<string>...adapting to the climate in their region and<lf>drawing strength from the weather phenomena.
<string>Exactly. What we're seeing is likely the synergy of<lf>a fierce blizzard and Jin Dahaad's agitation.
<string>More troubling still is how the resulting freeze<lf>may be disrupting the flow of energy here.
<string>Now that I think about it, everywhere seems<lf>to be in the season of Fallow...
<string>The normal flow of energy beyond this point has<lf>been blocked. We need to find Jin Dahaad!
<string>Alright. Let's prepare at the<lf>Iceshard Cliffs Base Camp first.

<string>Speak with me once you're ready to go.
<string>Shall we head out? Or was there<lf>something you needed to do first?
<string>Let's head out.
<string>I'd like to check the quests.
<string>(End Conversation)
<string>Understood. Then let's make<lf>for Jin Dahaad's location.

<string>Ah, Rove. You're here.
<string>You seem a little...under the weather.
<string>Now that you mention it... <lf>Um, Rove, are you all right?
<string>It bites deep, this cold. I daresay deeper still<lf>your furless flesh. Even mine cap is no avail...
<string>Of late I am gnawed, too, by an ill-ease I cannot<lf>name. A numb malaise. A rank ennui...
<string>That's rather concerning. Your body may just be<lf>reaching its limits, out in this cold.
<string><COLOR FF0000>#Rejected#</COLOR> Dia_stCh0802_Ms008050_0060_t008
<string>We're here to investigate this extreme cold.
<string>You should stay here and rest, Rove.
<string>I agree. You can't expect to hunt for relics<lf>if your body gives out on you.
<string>A kind offer, if one I hope never to require.
<string>There it is! Jin Dahaad seems even<lf>more aggressive than before.
<string>It may well be a response to the environment.<lf>Slaying authorized, for research and containment!
<string>Understood!
<string>When you're ready, accept the quest<lf>to continue the investigation.
<string>I'm glad you're not hurt. Great work removing one<lf>of the key factors exacerbating the cold.
<string>Let's just hope that allows the Landspine<lf>to begin a gradual process of thawing...
<string>Right. Let's go look for changes.
<string>It's become unfrozen almost as soon as we took care<lf>of Jin Dahaad. The Dragontorch's power is incredible.
<string>Now the energy can flow again. That's good, right?
<string>Well, that's the thinking, but...<lf>I'm not so sure it's good.
<string>Right. The flow of energy out is still<lf>extremely elevated from previous levels.
<string>What do you think will happen now?
<string>I don't know. We'll have to continue investigating<lf>to figure that out.
<string>Agreed, though we are depending on Olivia's team<lf>for many of those answers...
<string>In the meantime, we should continue to monitor<lf>each region for any anomalies.
<string>Right. Let's get to it.
