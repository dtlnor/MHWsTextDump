<string>Hey, do you have a minute?
<string>We've been researching the ruins at the Iceshard<lf>Cliffs based on that tip from Rove, but—
<string>To cut to the chase, a Blangonga decided the<lf>survey team was invading its turf and attacked.
<string>We'd been taking pains not to draw any monsters'<lf>attention, but sadly some of the team were injured.
<string>I see. They may have run into an especially<lf>aggressive monster. How are their wounds?
<string>Not too serious, thankfully. The team's safety is my<lf>responsibility, but there's only so much I can do...
<string>Alright. I'll head there straight away.
<string>Oh. Um...are you sure? I know you have other<lf>investigations and requests on your plate.
<string>I'm worried about the team there, but I also want<lf>to help out my Handler.
<string>Let me take care of this for you.
<string>...Right! Thank you very much!
<string>There. That's the Blangonga. It seems even more<lf>riled now than when the team encountered it...
<string>It could be agitated from the incident with your<lf>injured researcher. It might lash out again.
<string>I don't think we have a choice here. Requesting<lf>Guild authorization.
<string>Granted. You are authorized to hunt the target.
<string>Thank you for taking care of that Blangonga.
<string>I... I'm doubly sorry for putting my team in<lf>danger and then making you clean up the mess.
<string>Triply so, considering that Blangonga would have<lf>been fine if not for my own carelessness...
<string>I'm confident you'll put those lessons to good<lf>use, going forward.
<string>...Thank you. Now that the team's safety has been<lf>secured, we can continue our survey of the ruins.
<string>Um... Would you mind if I asked you to join me for a bit?
<string>There's something I'd like for you to see.
<string>Is this from the age of Wyveria?
<string>Yes. These relics are the subject of our current<lf>research. And what you protected for us.
<string>I protected these relics?
<string>Well, more specifically, you protected our ability<lf>to discover them. The joy of that... Thank you.
<string>Of course. But are you sure you don't want to stay<lf>here and join in the survey yourself?
<string>As fascinating as it is, my focus lies elsewhere<lf>right now.
<string>When you made the decision to slay Zoh Shia, you<lf>protected the entire ecosystem here.
<string>Thanks to that, normal life has continued for<lf>these people. Our investigation, as well. So—
<string>I'd like to repay you for that. As your Handler.
<string>I still have a lot to learn, but I'll do all I<lf>can to keep growing!
<string>I have every confidence in you, Alma.
