<string>Erik contacted me! He says some kind of<lf>expanse has been discovered right under Azuz!
<string>Gemma and I are excited beyond belief.<lf>Should we go ask Olivia what it's all about?
<string>Hey, did you know that some kind of expanse<lf>was discovered beneath Azuz?
<string>Alma and Gemma are quite excited.<lf>Why don't we ask Olivia for more details?
<string>Hey! Over here!
<string>Olivia, what's this I hear about an expanse<lf>discovered under Azuz?
<string>Erik told you.
<string>OK, so did you know that Werner has been<lf>working on mapping the Wyrmways?
<string>He's been thorough: their locations, dimensions,<lf>environments, Wyvern Milk supply and consumption.
<string>And he discovered what we're calling<lf>a Wyrmway nexus deep beneath Azuz.
<string>He said it looks like the remnants of a workshop<lf>from maybe a dozen generations ago. It's uncertain.
<string>Anyway, we got clearance to head down there and—
<string>Let's go! Imagine the materials!
<string>Ancient ruins like none we've ever seen!
<string>OK, OK... Calm down, we're just checking it out<lf>and coming right back. Shall we head out now?
<string>Are you ready to head down?
<string>Let's go.
<string>I need a little time.
<string>As you say. Werner's waiting.
<string>Werner's waiting for us.<lf>Let's not tempt fate by delaying too long.
<string>Where's Werner now?
<string>He was repairing an old lift that he thinks might<lf>lead down into the expanse. I guess we'll see.
<string>Hunter, Werner is the other way.
<string>Is there anything that man can't repair?<lf>Makes you wonder how his brain is wired.
<string>Werner's always been like that.
<string>Do you think it fell into disuse<lf>after the lift broke?
<string>Or did the lift break because there was no one<lf>left to maintain it?
<string>Werner!
<string>Oh, Erik... Uh, what's with the entourage?
<string>They'd like to accompany us, unless you object?
<string>It's fine.
<string>Hunter, let's head down.
<string>Don't worry. I guarantee it's safe.
<string>Wow. It's bigger than I thought.
<string>And it looks like it opens up down below.
<string>We should go by Seikret.
<string>Let's set up a makeshift camp here.
<string>I'll stay and help. The rest of you can<lf>continue on down.
<string>Thanks.
<string>Looking good. Let's go catch up with the others.
<string>It's awfully quiet. I thought there'd at least<lf>be some endemic life.
<string>The Wyrmway seems to still be functioning.
<string>In times long past, this energy must have<lf>pumped life through their civilization.
<string>Such serenity...
<string>Heh. You do like to wander about.
<string>Check it out, Hunter. This is a Wyrmway nexus.
<string>"Nexus" meaning...?
<string>Think of it like a junction in the Wyrmways.
<string>Right now, the Wyvern Milk supply is low, but in<lf>Firespring the Wyrmways will pump at full volume.
<string>What a nexus does is take all the energy stored<lf>here and disperses it where it needs to go.
<string>If this much current is still flowing generations<lf>later, they must have used a ton of Wyvern Milk.
<string>That's what my calculations show, yes.
<string>Considering how long it's been abandoned,<lf>the place has aged...surprisingly well.
<string>So, what's the verdict?
<string>That it's not a Guild concern, for now.
<string>What? No no no. It can't be!
<string>I...I don't believe it!
<string>Everybody, get over here!
<string>What is that?
<string>Gogmazios! Here, in the Forbidden Lands!
<string>I've heard the name before, but...only in records...
<string>The Specter of War...? You've gotta be kidding me...
<string>We have to report this to Professor Fabius!
<string>Not yet. We need to confirm as much<lf>as we can first.
<string>It looks like it's sleeping.<lf>We'd better avoid disturbing it.
<string>Gogmazios, huh...?
<string>A recent development... The Academy now classifies<lf>it as an elder dragon.
<string>Despite its size, it's famously elusive...<lf>There and gone, like a specter.
<string><COLOR FF0000>#Rejected#</COLOR> Dia_stCh7400_Ms740010_0180_t004
<string>I've read that it feeds on gunpowder. Is that true?
<string>There have been documented incidents from various<lf>nations where their armories have been plundered.
<string>There were even cases of large weapons like<lf>Dragonators vanishing without a trace.
<string>It wasn't until Gogmazios's discovery that anyone had<lf>any clue to who or what was behind these incidents.
<string>Is that heavy oil?
<string>Similar, yes. It's heavy drakesbone oil.
<string>Gogmazios's drakesbone oil contains<lf>gunpowder components.
<string>It's extremely volatile, and changes states<lf>at certain temperatures.
<string>Heated up, the oil produces a nightmarish<lf>blast yield.
<string>Werner, check out its back.
<string>Hm? The stone pillar? Those grooves look<lf>like they're by design...
<string>What's that? It's glowing.
<string>Tube-like fibers...and the grooves are...<lf>Right, I see. Directional energy.
<string>What are we dealing with?
<string>I'd say it's some kind of high-output ancient<lf>weapon that's powered by Wyvern Milk.
<string>A weapon!? I thought they didn't have any...
<string>Stack up enough facts, and that's called the truth.
<string>Weapons—<lf>the people here had them, sure enough.
<string>I can't believe all of this was sitting<lf>right underneath Azuz!
<string>Their settlement is full of gunpowder ingredients.<lf>If that thing escapes, it'll be all over.
<string>I still can't believe they possessed weapons in<lf>this land even further back than the fall.
<string>Yes, fascinating, but not what interests me.
<string>What interests me is whether or not we can still<lf>use that weapon.
<string>Why...would we do that?
<string>Look at the size of it! Clearly, it's built<lf>to take on monsters.
<string>Can we make it work?
<string>Ha! It's not about "can we."<lf>We have to make it work.
<string>Without it, we don't stand a chance.<lf>That's the situation we're dealing with here.
<string>Alright. Let's report our findings to Fabius.
<string>This mission is too critical for us to make<lf>any mistakes.
<string>Gogmazios... Of all the threats...
<string>Under normal circumstances, we MIGHT stand a chance<lf>of repelling it with Dragonators and Demolishers.
<string>But we don't have those luxuries here.
<string>Then there's no other choice.<lf>We've only one path forward.
<string>We have to rebuild that ancient weapon,<lf>restore its lost technology, and use it.
<string>Once we see what it can do, we can gauge its<lf>utility and risks, and decide what comes next.
<string>You know: trailblaze? Unlock the future?<lf>I thought you were all into this stuff.
<string>Werner.
<string>The Dragontorch, the Wyvern Milk, a weapon designed<lf>for exactly that. What part aren't you seeing?
<string>Walk me through what this entails.
<string>The weapon works by charging up energy<lf>from the Wyvern Milk.
<string>We just have to hook it up to the nexus<lf>and give it a direct supply.
<string>This all hinges on whether or not we can<lf>dislodge it from the monster's back.
<string>OK then, that's where we'll focus our attacks.<lf>It'll serve to soften our target anyway.
<string>We'll need fire weapons, then.
<string>Let's not forget we need to repair the nexus, too...<lf>right next to the Gogmazios while it's sleeping.
<string>What!?
<string>Werner!
<string>Hmm...very well.
<string>All smithies, proceed to the nexus.<lf>Werner will lead the repair process.
<string>Stay on your guards. If there's any sign of trouble,<lf>return immediately.
<string>What if we can't get it running in time?
<string>Then the mission's prospects are grim indeed.<lf>We should be prepared for the worst eventuality.
<string>I'm always prepared for such, but...
<string>Hey. Don't worry. We'll make it work.
<string>Anything else?
<string>We saw these, like, pieces stuck to Gogmazios.
<string>They had a faint glow to them.<lf>I'm curious what they're for.
<string>I see... Li Lee, you're our anti-wyvern weapons<lf>expert. See if you can identify what they might be.
<string>Yes sir.
<string>One final matter. Taking down Gogmazios poses<lf>a significant challenge, especially with our forces.
<string>In light of this, I am calling in a certain hunter<lf>to help. Her name is Nadia.
<string>Nadia's coming!?
<string>We don't need her. Keep her away!<lf>We can handle it on our own!
<string>Here we go again...
<string>I'll provide everyone with detailed posts and<lf>formations at a later summons.
<string>Until then, hunters: Begin your preparations.<lf>Smithies: Make ready for departure.
<string>Dismissed.
<string>Shall we resume our work?
<string>Let's get back to it.
<string>I need more time.
<string>Understood.
<string>Come talk to me when you're ready.
