<string>Well?
<string>It's among the best we've made.
<string>It's all thanks to you.
<string>Good work, Maki.
<string>Thank you. We owe it all to you.
<string>No. We did this together.
<string>Everyone, great work! We did it!
<string>Stunning make.
<string>Stunning amount, too!
<string>The temperatures were so steady!
<string>It's the quality of the oil!
<string>You did well.
<string>We owe you and Azuz an apology.
<string>Hm? Right...
<string>It's fine. You did it for us.
<string>We were the ones who got carried away.
<string>All's well as long as the Everforge is working.
<string>Thought I'd seen it all.
<string>Gemma!
<string>The boss said I did well.<lf>I think he's really excited for the next one.
<string>That's great.
<string>When everything was falling apart...<lf>I was ready to give up, you know.
<string>But then...you really yelled the courage right back into me.
<string>You single-handedly saved the day!
<string>I dunno about that.
<string>I think you can't get a finished product without<lf>all the components coming together, right?
<string>Yeah!
<string>People...
<string>Sure are strong.
<string>The Plenty is here!
