<string>Did ya know we make our windows with the same<lf>stone as our gemchimes? You know the ones, right?
<string>The lighter the blue, the better the windows.<lf>Clear as water, they are.
<string>The wind erodes the gemchimes something terrible<lf>with all that clanking together they do.
<string>But the windows take a hit, too. Heck, the Sandtide<lf>may just blow your house across the Plains!
<string>That's why I'm here, y'see. I'm Kunafa's official<lf>window fixer-upper!
<string>Hey ya! Wanna know about those mining carts<lf>rolling around?
<string>They bring the stone we harvest home. Lotsa prayers<lf>go into hoping for some decent materials!
<string>The windows are always the worst victims<lf>of the Sandtide. But that's why I'm here.
<string>And the Sandtide's here to test my window-making<lf>skills. And sometimes my patience, too! Ha!
<string>Hey there, traveler!
<string>Hard not to be happy during the Plenty! No need<lf>to worry about any more shattered windows!
<string>In this village, you do some work, you get something<lf>in thanks. That's how it works!
<string>I'd say you've done your fair share of work for us,<lf>so it's about time we start repaying it!
<string>Sounds like Y'sai's been brushing up his cooking<lf>skills. Said he's got new people to impress.
<string>Nobody is questioning the Vanguard's skill, but we<lf>aren't too happy how often they're in the thick of it.
<string>We'd like it if Zatoh and the others could stick<lf>around, y'know!
