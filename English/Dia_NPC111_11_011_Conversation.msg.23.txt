<string>Did you know we make our windows with the same<lf>stone as our gemchimes? You know the ones, right?
<string>The lighter the blue, the better the windows.<lf>Clear as water, they are.
<string>The wind erodes the gemchimes something terrible<lf>with all that clanking together they do.
<string>But the windows take a hit, too. Heck, the Sandtide<lf>may just blow your house across the Plains!
<string>That's why I'm here! I'm Kunafa's official<lf>window fixer-upper!
<string>Did you see those mining carts rolling around?
<string>They bring the stone we harvest home. We can only<lf>pray that it'll yield some decent materials.
<string>The windows are always the worst victims<lf>of the Sandtide. But that's why I'm here.
<string>And the Sandtide's here to test my window-making<lf>skills. And sometimes my patience, too! Ha!
<string>Hey there, traveler!
<string>Hard not to be happy during the Plenty! No need<lf>to worry about any more shattered windows!
<string>In this village, you do some work, you get something<lf>in thanks. That's how it works!
<string>I'd say you've done your fair share of work for us,<lf>so it's about time we start repaying it!
<string>Sounds like Y'sai's been brushing up his cooking<lf>skills. Said he's got new people to impress.
<string>Nobody is questioning the Vanguard's skill, but we<lf>aren't too happy how often they're in the thick of it.
<string>We'd like it if Zatoh and the others could stick<lf>around, y'know.
<string>You're Y'sai's guest, right?
<string>Do me a favor and visit him again sometime, yeah?<lf>It's been a while since I've seen him so happy.
<string>I hope Zatoh is alright out there. I know it's the<lf>Vanguard's job to watch for threats and all...
<string>But I hope he and the water bearers come<lf>back sooner rather than later.
<string>Windows, roofs, even whole dang walls in shambles!<lf>What a mess. At least no one got hurt.
<string>Guess we have you to thank for that!
<string>First time I ever saw that many Doshaguma.
<string>This Sandtide sure was something else.<lf>Completely out of nowhere, too.
<string>Really made my work look shoddy with the amount<lf>of windows it shattered.
<string>Hey, have you noticed?<lf>Everything is all fixed up!
<string>All the craftsmen in the village chipped in to help rebuild.<lf>I'd say it looks even better than before!
<string>I don't know why I've been so unmotivated lately.
<string>Work has been slow, too.<lf>But I guess I should be grateful for that...
<string>When did Y'sai get so dependable?
<string>I need to get my act together.<lf>Can't let him get all the attention.
<string>Ya know, you're all that Zatoh and Y'sai<lf>talk about these days.
<string>So even when you've been away for a while,<lf>it still feels like you're nearby.
<string>I hope I can be of some help to you!
