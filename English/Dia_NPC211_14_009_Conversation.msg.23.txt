<string>Watching Poogie always brings me calm.
<string>I suppose putting it that way makes it seem as<lf>if I'm often agitated, though it isn't so.
<string>No, no. I can assure you.
<string>I had always thought that frogs were creatures<lf>that rode on a Poogie's back.
<string>Is that not the case?
<string>How long do you suppose the stars we can see from<lf>here have been shining?
<string>You must be the hunter, then.<lf>The stars seen from Suja are lovely.
<string>I believe that indecision, worry, and anguish are<lf>all normal, healthy things.
<string>Heh... After all, I'm always doing at least one.
<string>You wrestled indecision, worry, and anguish for<lf>your answer, mm?
<string>You are amazing. Know that.
<string>Whatever our worries, the stars shine on the same.<lf>Does that not lift your spirits?
<string>I heard the news of Wounded Hollow. I am grateful<lf>the danger is lessened, even a bit.
<string>Are you well? Still racing about from place<lf>to place?
<string>Are you well? Still racing about from place<lf>to place?
<string>This tranquility... You must have raced about<lf>from place to place.
<string>Perhaps I'll set out on a journey<lf>along with Poogie...
<string>If we are able, we shall travel to your homeland.<lf>Poogie will surely be well-loved there, mm?
<string>I am given to wonder, do you face monsters in the<lf>same fashion as I face Poogie?
<string>Is that not what it means to engage with another<lf>life? To you and me both?
<string>Whatever our worries, the stars shine on the same.<lf>Does that not lift your spirits?
