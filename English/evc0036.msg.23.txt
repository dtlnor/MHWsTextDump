<string>Nata!
<string>Are you all right?
<string>So, you said you were investigating<lf>the monster that attacked our home?
<string>Yes. The white monster that caused<lf>Nata to flee your village.
<string>Tasheen, do you know what it is?
<string>Why did it do this to our village?
<string>Nata...the time has come for me to tell you about<lf>this land and its people's long, long history.
<string>I intended to share this with<lf>you the day you were lost.
<string>It is time we set you on your path.
<string>Come with me.
<string>We Keepers have carried on the<lf>traditions of this land for eons.
<string>Ages ago, it was known<lf>as the capital, Wyveria.
<string>This was a city?
<string>Yes. You passed through a massive<lf>structure to reach us, did you not?
<string>That is what remains of the outer bailey—
<string>the wall around the capital's vast expanse.
<string>That's incredible.
<string>Yes, the people of Wyveria had access to limitless<lf>energy that let them control nature at will.
<string>They built an advanced civilization<lf>and reached the height of prosperity.
<string>But Wyveria fell.
<string>Its people and civilization were lost—<lf>except for the traces that still remain today.
<string>You mean traces like the tunnel Nata passed through?
<string>That is a Wyrmway, a path for<lf>energy to travel long distances.
<string>They continue to supply energy<lf>to every corner of the land.
<string>But to what effect it may have...we no longer know.
<string>So then...
<string>That means Wylk was created here in Wyveria!
<string>We live at the heart of Wyveria's energy production.
<string>Our people subsist on it.
<string>It's incredible... I can't believe how versatile it is.
<string>After the fall of Wyveria, the Keepers<lf>remained to hold vigil over its legacy.
<string>And our watch has continued since time immemorial.
<string>What's this?
<string>An archive of the city's research journals.<lf>Most of them are beyond our understanding.
<string>Wait, then...who are the Keepers?
<string>We are the descendants of those<lf>who studied this limitless energy,
<string>and applied it to usher Wyveria<lf>into an era of prosperity.
