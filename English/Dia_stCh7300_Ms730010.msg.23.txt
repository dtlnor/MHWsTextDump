<string>Hey, guess what. Rove got in touch! Said he's<lf>discovered some kind of "talking artifact."
<string>What do you think it is? I can't even begin<lf>to imagine! Shall we go visit him at his hideaway?
<string>Oh, did I mention? Rove got in touch. He said he's<lf>stumbled upon some sort of "talking artifact."
<string>Shall we go see what he's found?
<string>Well met, friends, and my thanks for<lf>making the journey.
<string>I asked you here but for one reason alone:<lf>this talking artifact.
<string>It appeared without warning, and utters the most<lf>confounding things... Without a mouth, at that!
<string>What say we examine it more closely together?
<string>Sure, let's have a look.
<string>Now isn't the best time.
<string>Aye, that's the spirit!
<string>Errands to run?<lf>So be it. I can wait.
<string>If it's an artifact we're dealing with, Alma knows<lf>the most about archaeology. I'll go fetch her.
<string>If you need me again, I'll be at the Scarlet<lf>Forest Base Camp.
<string>Fascinating... I've never seen an artifact<lf>quite like this before.
<string>Rove, did you say it could talk?
<string>Listen for yourselves. Its utterings<lf>continue as we speak.
<string>—ing measurements... Analyzing projections—
<string>Completing assessment of this planet's viable<lf>harvestable resources...
<string>My word! How is it able to vocalize? Does it<lf>contain some kind of instrument or sound box?
<string>Assessment: Grade VI. A rich and bountiful planet<lf>such as this would be well worth acquiring!
<string>Sharing with primary—complete.<lf>Initiate invasion and s-s-subjuga—
<string>Hmm... Huh? It stopped.
<string>Yes, right in the middle of "invasion and<lf>subjugation." That doesn't sound scary at all...
<string>We should have a look around, check for anomalies.<lf>You never know.
<string>I will remain here. Stay on your guard out there.
<string>The scoutflies are reacting.
<string>Let's see where they take us.
<string>What's all this!?
<string>Native lifeforms approaching... Attempting contact<lf>via reconnaissance units.
<string>We've got company! Biology and temperament...<lf>unclear, but their behavior is abnormally hostile!
<string>The Guild authorizes you to neutralize this threat!
<string>Understood!
<string>Terminating combat protocol.<lf>Core target data acquired.
<string>Sharing with primary—complete. Extermination<lf>unit will be generated for local deterrence.
<string>Resuming subjugation measures.
<string>There go the scoutflies again!
<string>Come on!
<string>What do you think those monsters we fought were?
<string><COLOR FF0000>#Rejected#</COLOR> Dia_stCh7300_Ms730010_0080_t002
<string>Long legs, rotund bodies, and mask-like<lf>attachments...
<string>They resemble an obscure group of 17 Megalithic<lf>artifacts, lovingly coined the Mega 17.
<string>Up there!
<string>Kweh! Kweh kweh!
<string>*bleep*<lf>Requesting immediate extrication...
<string>Oh my! It's in trouble!<lf>And...it can talk!?
<string>All I'm hearing is that baby Seikret calling<lf>for help!
<string>No time to lose! Hunter, the Guild<lf>authorizes you to slay the Nerscylla!
<string>Understood!
<string>Hey uh, this Nerscylla is acting kinda funny!
<string>Whatever's going on here must be affecting it!
<string>Where'd it learn these new tricks?
<string>Don't let your guard down!
<string>Energy delivery systems compromised.<lf>Core temperature critically low.
<string>Kweh!? Kuh... (sneezing) Kwe-choo!
<string>*bleep* *blip* Increasing thermogenic motor<lf>function is strongly advised, Alpha!
<string>Lifeform, please prioritize eliminating that<lf>creature over providing assistance to us.
<string>Kweh, kweh!
<string>Translating: "Be careful."<lf>You don't want to end up like us...*blip*
<string>There's more of them here!
<string>Stay alert!
<string>What are those things?
<string>I don't remember seeing creatures like that<lf>the last time we came through the Cliffs!
<string>I thought these might be Nerscylla Hatchlings,<lf>but there's no way!
<string>They're everywhere!
<string>There is much to glean from newer relics.
<string>Though, referring to relics as "newer" sounds a<lf>touch paradoxical, does it not?
<string>This world, boundless in scope, plays host to any<lf>number of chance encounters.
<string>Such junctures of fate can be fair or foul. However,<lf>one must be capable of discerning which is which.
<string>I was right. That Nerscylla is under the influence<lf>of whatever exactly is going on.
<string>We need to cast aside all our preconceptions.<lf>Have you reviewed your items?
<string>Well done! That couldn't have been an easy hunt.
<string>Let's go free those two tied up back there.<lf>They may be able to tell us what's going on.
<string>*blip* Removal of restraints detected.<lf>An agreeable course of action. Noted.
<string>We're just glad you're safe, um...<lf>whoever you are.
<string>If you are inquiring as to our names,<lf>I am Omega, and my companion here is Alpha.
<string>Kweh!
<string>It's not a Seikret?
<string>Query. Who are you, and what information can you<lf>provide about this place we find ourselves in?
<string>Oh, uh... This will take some explaining.
<string>...I understand. Then it is as I surmised.<lf>We are no longer in the world of our origin.
<string>I had noted Alpha's fluffiness level was higher than<lf>normal. A foreign planet's influence explains it.
<string>Fluffiness level? Foreign planet?
<string>Comment rescinded. Pay me no heed. What matters<lf>is that we have come from far, far away.
<string>Tell us about yourselves.
<string>"Familiar being"?
<string>How did the Nerscylla get you?
<string>(End Conversation)
<string>Could you tell us a little more about yourselves?
<string>Acknowledged. We are on a journey with<lf>a very specific purpose.
<string>Along the way, we discovered an "interdimensional<lf>rift"—a tear in the fabric between worlds.
<string>Upon peering into it, I was quite surprised to<lf>make visual contact with a familiar being.
<string>To investigate, we leapt into the rift and<lf>crossed over into your world.
<string>What do you mean, "familiar being"?
<string>Does it have anything to do with those small<lf>monsters and the Nerscylla's aberrant behavior?
<string>Affirmative. Those creatures were manufactured<lf>by one of my compatriots.
<string>In the past, my homeland invested a great deal<lf>of energy in the conquest of other planets.
<string>To achieve this, they produced a variety<lf>of frames.
<string>The greatest and most elite of these was a weapon<lf>known as the Omega frame.
<string>It possessed the unique ability to evolve itself.
<string>It would begin by analyzing the structure,<lf>capabilities, and behavior of opponents.
<string>It could then internalize and implement any data<lf>it found viable via advanced generative features.
<string>That same process must have created what you refer<lf>to as "small monsters" and an "aberrant Nerscylla."
<string>OK, but you said "compatriot."<lf>Does that mean you, uh...
<string>Negative. Admittedly, I have used the Omega frame in<lf>the past, but as you see, I am now a harmless model.
<string>Would it be clearer if we used unique identifiers?<lf>If so, you may call the other one Omega Planetes.
<string>While searching for planets to invade, some anomalous<lf>event no doubt resulted in its arrival here.
<string>Such an occurrence is not at all<lf>uncommon in space. *bleep*
<string>In any event, Omega Planetes has scanned this<lf>planet and concluded its subjugation has merit.
<string>It will now devote every effort to learning from<lf>your native lifeforms to achieve that conquest.
<string>How did you get yourselves all webbed up like that?
<string>"Webbed up." I surmise you mean the sticky fibers<lf>that restrained us. I have no good answer for you.
<string>Alpha aside, I for one offer no nutritional<lf>value as prey.
<string>Interestingly, had I not been caught, you may well<lf>have disposed of me along with the other weapons.
<string>Kweh, kweh...
<string>To be perfectly honest,<lf>this is a lot to absorb, even for us.
<string>But the thrust of it is that a powerful being is<lf>trying to wreak havoc on our world, right?
<string>And when havoc is in the wreaking,<lf>there's only one thing for us to do.
<string>We have to stop Omega Planetes.
<string>I will respect your decision.
<string>It is self-evident that the invaded would resist<lf>the invader. I wish you luck.
<string>Kweh! Kweh kweh?
<string>...Alpha has just pointed out that we have<lf>yet to reward you for saving us.
<string>Confirmed. If it pleases you, we will aid your<lf>efforts by providing what information we can.
<string>And one more thing—I came across this during my travels.<lf>It may prove useful in augmenting your tactical options.
<string>Do you have any idea where we might find<lf>Omega Planetes?
<string>The Omega frame, by design, will gravitate<lf>toward a specific target—
<string>Namely, the opponent most likely to augment<lf>its power.
<string>So, the strongest creature in the area—<lf>Oh no. Jin Dahaad?
<string>That'd be my bet.
<string>Then there's not a moment to lose!<lf>We depart as soon as we're prepared.
<string>Kweh! Kweh!
