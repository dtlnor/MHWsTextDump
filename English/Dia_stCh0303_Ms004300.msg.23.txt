<string>So you're the travelers who helped Nata.
<string>Tell me, is the Everforge still out there?
<string>Does the Downpour still occur?
<string>Downpour? You mean in the forest,<lf>where the Wudwuds live?
<string>So it's a forest now, is it? Good to hear the Wudwuds<lf>are carrying on...not that I've ever met them.
<string>So your people are able to find the sustenance<lf>you need to live without venturing outside?
<string>With our rich reserves of Wyvern Milk? Oh, yes.
<string>I'd like to know more about that,<lf>if you don't mind explaining...
<string>They were just teaching me about the use of Wylk—<lf>Of Wyvern Milk, that is.
<string>It seems its applications are far more<lf>broad than anything I'd imagined.
<string>It can do so much more than amplify firepower.
<string>Huh. So the people outside call it Wylk?<lf>Wylk... Wyvern Milk... Similar.
<string>Perhaps the name Wyvern Milk slowly<lf>changed form over the centuries?
<string>Ahh, I'm still just reeling. I knew it, of course,<lf>but seeing that the outside world truly exists!
<string>I can hardly believe it's you, Nata.
<string>You've gotten bigger!
<string>I'm so sorry. I had no idea what<lf>you were all going through...
<string>I should have been here for you.
<string>Don't be foolish. All we wanted<lf>was for you to be safe!
<string>We're sorry we sent you out there on your own.<lf>Everything happened so fast...
<string>You must have been so frightened.
<string>It's all right. I wasn't scared...
<string>So, who are these people who rescued you, Nata?
<string>They're called hunters and, um...
<string>They're searching for the thing<lf>that attacked our village.
<string>Searching... Whatever for?<lf>To find it and do what?
<string>Well, what matters is that you're finally home,<lf>Nata. With us, where you belong.
<string>R-Right. But, I...
<string>I still want to travel together with them,<lf>just for awhile longer.
<string>Excuse me. May I ask what you're doing?
<string>As you can see, I'm using Wyvern Milk<lf>to speed along these crops' growth.
<string>Things felt rather desperate in the wake of the<lf>attack, but thankfully the farm is back in order.
<string>Pardon me, but...what is this place?
<string>And you are...? Ah, yes.<lf>The outsiders Tasheen mentioned.
<string>Beneath us, those who have<lf>completed their task lie resting.
<string>It's curious. The day after the attack, we'd lost<lf>all our tools. We dug with our bare hands.
<string>But cuts on fingertips heal.
<string>I'll carry on my friends' share of our mission<lf>here. I believe that's what must be done.
<string>A moment? The smallish fellow that came with you...
<string>Might they be a Wudwud? I know of the Wudwuds.<lf>From the ancient records.
<string>No, my friend is what's called a Felyne.
<string>Oh, my... Not a Wudwud, then.<lf>They look just like the records tell, though.
<string>That's quite the surprise.
<string>Pardon, but am I correct in taking you for an<lf>outsider? Is it true that you confront monsters?
<string>Yes, that's correct.
<string>So it's true... I can't quite understand it. Do you<lf>intend to tread the same path walked a millennium ago?
<string>Though, I wonder what I might do<lf>when faced with a monster...
<string>Would I be able to see it as another part of<lf>nature, as the old teachings hold...?
<string>This place is seriously amazing. Wonder and<lf>confusion are duking it out in my head for control.
<string>We need to go hear what Tasheen has to say.<lf>Let's get ready and meet up.
<string>Now's a good time to take a break.
<string>(Use the Facility)
<string>(End Conversation)
<string>It's time I showed you what our ancestors created.<lf>Are you ready to go?
<string>Can I ask you to lead the way?
<string>I need a little more time.
<string>I was going to tell Nata these things the day it<lf>all happened. Now, the whole truth will be yours.
<string>Very well.
