<string>The village is this way.
<string>All this...was part of the village too, huh?
<string>Yes, there were homes. People, too.
<string>But then...the Wraith ruined everything.
<string>I'm sure everyone's just hiding now,<lf>though. We just have to find them...
<string>That Rathalos too? It's behaving as erratically<lf>as the Doshaguma from before!
<string>The crystal exploded...<lf>Must've been from contact with its breath.
<string>First a white Doshaguma, now a white Rathalos?
<string>I don't think this is the Rathalos we know and<lf>love... Keep that guard up.
<string>Stay sharp, that Rathalos may have some surprises<lf>for us, same as the Doshaguma before.
<string>Why do you suppose that Rath was so focused on<lf>that door?
<string>Hunter, please. Help my uncle, my village. Please,<lf>you have to help them!
<string>What's a monster like that doing so near the<lf>village? What are they?
<string>Do the Keepers know what those things are...?
<string>It's my own village, and I still don't know<lf>anything. I hate feeling so useless...
<string>Hunter, what even is that thing?<lf>It's not like any Rathalos I've ever seen...
<string>Why is that Rath itchin' so bad to get<lf>past that door?
<string>I'll go tell Tasheen that it's safe.
<string>What did you do?
<string>This person's a "hunter," Uncle.<lf>They study monsters and, if needed, slay them.
<string>People challenging monsters?<lf>Incredible...
<string>You saved Nata, and now you've<lf>saved me as well. Thank you.
<string>I am Tasheen. I was friends with Nata's father,<lf>and had been caring for the boy since his passing.
<string>We're from an organization called the Hunters Guild.<lf>That's Alma and Gemma.
<string>Nata told us what happened to you, so we came to help<lf>and investigate the monster that attacked your village.
<string>You're after that thing? I see...
<string>Are the others safe, Uncle?
<string>I suppose we should start with that.<lf>I'll show you to our village. Come.
<string>This way.
<string>I can't recall what happened after I helped<lf>Nata escape and blocked the passage.
<string>All I remember is the sight of<lf>that behemoth closing in...
<string>I awoke several days later.<lf>More days passed before I was even able to move.
<string>We gathered the survivors and built places to rest...<lf>For ourselves, and for those we lost.
<string>It was a labor without end.
<string>Once our wounds were healed, we unblocked<lf>the passage, and I descended into the tunnel.
<string>Immediately, my legs began to shake.
<string>It was madness. None of my people had<lf>ventured outside for a thousand years.
<string>I began to deeply lament my error,<lf>condemning Nata to some unknown void...
<string>I searched and searched<lf>to find him...to no avail.
<string>Surely someone must have found him, I prayed.
<string>But never did I imagine he<lf>would go as far as he did.
<string>Why... Why was I the only one to escape?
<string>The moment I saw that creature,<lf>I was certain we would all perish.
<string>But I couldn't let that happen to you.
<string>And now I know the path I chose was right.<lf>The others will feel the same.
<string>Our village is this way.
<string>Researchers...
<string>Yes, once. Now we are just people getting by.
<string>That's fascinating... I don't even know where to begin.
<string>Well, considering how handy they are with Wylk,<lf>it does stand to reason.
<string>Is that what you name it out there?<lf>Here, we call it Wyvern Milk.
<string>Can you tell me more about Wyvern Milk?
<string>Tell me about the history of the Keepers.
<string>(End Conversation)
<string>Where is Wyl-, sorry, Wyvern Milk produced?
<string>Deep underground. In the heart of Wyveria,<lf>there is a shrine.
<string>It houses something we call the Dragontorch,<lf>the source of all Wyvern Milk.
<string>"The Dragontorch..." What can you tell us about it?
<string>Only that it has existed since the age of Wyveria.<lf>We know not how it works, nor how to control it...

<string><COLOR FF0000>#Rejected#</COLOR> Dia_stCh0302_Ms004290_0180_t021a
<string>The white monsters seemed fixated on Wyvern Milk.
<string>Do the Keepers know of any reason<lf>that might explain their behavior?
<string>That you should see for yourselves. If I may,<lf>I'd like to show you there later.
<string>Why is it that the Keepers haven't been<lf>outside for so long?
<string>You see, Wyveria fell a millennium ago.
<string>Of those who survived, half of them<lf>left this land, and half of them stayed.
<string>Our ancestors were those who remained—<lf>the founders of this village, Sild.
<string>But why? They could have gone anywhere!
<string>It is said that all who lived in the capital<lf>helped it along its path to destruction.
<string>Our ancestors, in particular,<lf>played a crucial role in its demise.
<string>Staying was their way of taking responsibility.<lf>To keep watch...for the rest of time.
<string>The...the rest of time?
<string>What exactly did your ancestors do?
<string>I intend to show you. I think it would be for the best.
<string>Well then, let us depart as soon as you've<lf>had a chance to unload and prepare.
<string>Oh... In that case, do you mind<lf>if we set up over by the gate?
<string>There? Are you sure? You're welcome to it.
<string>That'll make a good spot for a Base Camp.
<string>Nata, before we go, you should say hello to<lf>the others. They'll be so happy to see you.
<string>OK.
<string>Good. We'll meet back in front of<lf>the gate once we're all ready.
<string>Well, Hunter, we did it. That's our most<lf>important objective in the bag.
<string>I'm so happy for Nata.
<string>But I'm scared to open that next door...<lf>Once we step through, there might be no turning back.
<string>Hunter, the village is this way.
<string>We'd like to have a base of operations for us and<lf>the other members of our team, if that's all right?
