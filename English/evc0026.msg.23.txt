<string>There it is! The White Wraith!
<string>OK, but what's the other one?
<string>From the look of it...
<string>That must be this region's apex predator.
<string>This could get ugly. We'd better keep<lf>our distance.
<string>We can observe from afar.
<string>Nata!
<string>You can't!
<string>Why? Why did it attack us?
<string>Did we...do something wrong?
<string>There must be a reason, right?
<string>You're a hunter...
<string>You've got a weapon and you do nothing?
<string>Give it to me! And I'll...
<string>
<string>I'll...!
<string>Why won't you let me goooo!?
<string>I wanna go home! Give me my village back!
<string>Look!
<string>Is that monster absorbing its energy?
<string>(intense electricity crackling)
<string>That doesn't look good.
<string>RUN!
<string>Oh shoot shoot shoot shoot!
<string>It's gone berserk! The village is doomed<lf>if we don't stop it!
<string>I'll find us a spot to lay low!
<string>I'm going too! We've got to get Nata outta here!
<string>Got it!
<string>I'll provide support for the time being!
<string>Thanks!
