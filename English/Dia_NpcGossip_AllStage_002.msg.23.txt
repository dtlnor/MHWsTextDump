<string>Let's see this through to the end, Livvie.
<string>Right. We'll finish what we came to do, together.
<string>No matter what storms come.
<string>If you could go anywhere in the world,<lf>where would you go?
<string>Hmm... I'd have to say Dundorma.<lf>So many memories there.
<string>I'd choose Val Habar for sure.
<string>Your timing was perfect, Livvie.
<string>Perhaps... But what do you think of<lf>a leaping approach?
<string>Oooh, tell me more.
<string>Is it just me, or are we in fine form lately?
<string>Well, they say too much training dulls your edge.
<string><ITALIC>They</ITALIC> say it.<lf>Never thought I'd hear <ITALIC>you</ITALIC> say it.
<string>Livvie...how are you taking to having<lf>a worthy rival around?
<string>Is this about <OTNAME>?
<string>So much talent, but you never see a smug grin or<lf>hear a boastful meow. I need to step up my game.
<string>I miss having Erik look at my teeth.
<string>He's not as free as he was on the sandship.
<string>None of us are...but I still miss it.
<string>I suppose it's about time I reminded<lf>Werner to eat...
<string>Way ahead of you. He and I just ate.
<string>Oh, you took care of it? Thanks.
