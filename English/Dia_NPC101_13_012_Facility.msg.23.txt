<string>How's it going?
<string>(End Conversation)
<string>Hey, you're looking lively!
<string>You want stuff, I want stuff. How's about we swap?
<string>This round of trade's coming in extra hot for ya.
<string>You're not just another guest. You're our savior.<lf>A far-flung friend to every one of us here.
<string>So, seeing as we're friends, I've got something<lf>to ask you. Got a minute?
<string>See, my guys here are all fascinated<lf>by the stuff you're carrying around.
<string>I thought maybe we could trade you some of what<lf>we've got? No pressure, if nothing catches your eye.
<string>Thanks. Hope to see you again.
<string>I'll make good use of it.
<string>Later.
<string>Another time.
<string>Grab anything you like.
