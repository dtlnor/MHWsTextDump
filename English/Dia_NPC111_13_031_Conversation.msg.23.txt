<string>...Ooh. Quite the beauty you've got there,<lf>traveler.
<string>That there, on your back. Let me take a good,<lf>close look.
<string>This was made with techniques I've never seen.<lf>Fascinating...
<string>Alright, let's get ready to work! I'm not<lf>letting the Oil <ITALIC>or</ITALIC> the Bonefolk outdo us!
<string>The ore processing techniques we use have been<lf>passed down through generations of Stonefolk.
<string>Bold, but delicate, and straightforward as a rock.<lf>Our work is our pride.
<string>The festival's on! Time for all our efforts to<lf>finally bear fruit!
<string>What do ya think? Hell of a celebration, eh!?
<string>You guys having fun!?
<string>Hey there, traveler!
<string>Azuz is home to every artisanal technique created,<lf>but nobody's more refined than us Stonefolk!
<string>You seen the Everforge up there yet? Helluva thing!
<string>It's the pride of us Flameborn. Thing's even <ITALIC>more</ITALIC><lf>impressive when the festival rolls 'round.
<string>What, the festival's not starting? Guess life's<lf>just full of surprises.
<string>Was the oil late? ...No, that doesn't seem right.
<string>But if it ain't that...then what <ITALIC>is</ITALIC> it?
<string>A monster that terrifying, and you go and <ITALIC>fight</ITALIC> it?<lf>Just who are you guys?
<string>This batch's some o' the finest Oricalcite I've<lf>ever seen.
<string>I guess this time around, credit goes to Maki...<lf>Well, to the Oilfolk. Not half bad, I gotta admit.
<string>If I'm honest, I always thought the Oilfolk kinda<lf>lacked guts.
<string>But talking to 'em, I can see they're made of<lf>stronger stuff. They're serious about their craft.
<string>Gotta say, that one girl was pretty sparky.<lf>You know her? The Oilfolk gal.
<string>I'm feelin' pretty good about this one.<lf>So...when's the next festival?
<string>Every time the festival rolled 'round, I'd have<lf>such a blast I never wanted it to end.
<string>But now that we gotta deal with a Firespring<lf>this long, it's a lot less fun...
<string>I was thinking of inviting that Oilfolk gal to go<lf>see the next festival with me, but...
<string>Doesn't really feel like the time, yeah?
<string>The Black Flame <ITALIC>again?</ITALIC> Guess that thing's as big<lf>a fan of the festival as us.
<string>Whew, if you hadn't shown up, the Everforge<lf>might've blown sky high.
<string>We owe you big! You're a real bright burner,<lf>friend.
<string>After all that chaos, the tribes put their heads<lf>together to prep for any future issues.
<string>With everybody acting all friendly now, maybe I<lf>can finally go talk to that Oilfolk gal...
<string>Ever since you lot got here, the vibe in Azuz<lf>has changed. In a good way, I mean.
<string>It's gotten a lot easier to talk to folks from the<lf>other tribes now.
<string>Even gotten pretty close with, uh...<ITALIC>her.</ITALIC>
<string>...So anyway, yeah! You have my thanks!
<string>Despite us all being Flameborn, each tribe has<lf>their own way of doing things.
<string>Up till now, I used to think the other folks were<lf>crazy for doing things wrong.
<string>But after getting to know 'em, I can see they got<lf>their reasons. ...Guess that shoulda been obvious.
<string>It's wild to think that up till just recently,<lf>something that obvious <ITALIC>wasn't.</ITALIC>
