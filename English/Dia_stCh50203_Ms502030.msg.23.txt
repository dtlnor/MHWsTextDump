<string>Greetings. Fine weather for angling, mm? Days like<lf>this always make a person hungry, don't they!
<string>Uh...
<string>Ahh, my famished fisherfellow, you are simply too<lf>much! Here, then. A tasty tip, just for you.
<string>Gravid Bowfin roe is downright delectable. Chock<lf>full of nutrition, too, they say.
<string>It's the perfect answer to an empty belly. Now,<lf>to fish one! Not a moment to lose!
<string>I can feel in my very bones that this is of vital<lf>importance to my fisherfellow's hunting career.
<string>And so, away you must go! Away, dear friend!<lf>I'll be eager to see the Gravid Bowfin you land!
<string>...Right.
<string>The intrepid angler returns! And with a fish to<lf>offer up in tribute. How very gracious.
<string>But I tease! I would never dream of pilfering the<lf>fruits of a fisherfellow's labors.
<string>That fish is yours to enjoy as you will.
<string>It's an ingredient almost tailor-made for<lf>camp grilling. You're hungry, aren't you?
<string>There are other fine cooking fish, as well. Drop<lf>a line next time you crave culinary adventure!
<string>You can find Gravid Bowfin pretty much anywhere,<lf>but you don't catch many. Too cagey, maybe?
<string>Their numbers go up during the Plenty, though.<lf>That's your chance.
<string>Oh, and I catch more right around dawn and dusk.<lf>Not sure exactly why, though.
