<string>OK, let's move out!
<string>Another monster's horning in!
<string>Looks like it's asleep.
<string>There! That's our target!
<string>Whoaaa, I'm dizzy...!
<string>Gah! So bright!
<string>Gah, I'm all tingly!

<string>It's paralyzed! Go all out!
<string>The monster's exhausted!
<string>Careful! That's one furious foe!
<string>So, where to next?
<string>We're getting paid well for THAT one!

<string>Whew! You're a life-saver!
<string>Alright, time to get serious!
<string>You OK? Nothing broken?
<string>No...
<string>The hunt is on!
<string>What kinda monster we after this time?
<string>I'm all fired up!
<string>The terrain there... I think we can use it in<lf>combat!
<string>I don't feel so good...
<string>The monster's debilitated!
<string>It's looking weak! Almost there!
<string>We've got it on the ground!
<string>Looks like it's moving to a new area!
<string>A part broke off! We'll have to carve it later!
<string>The monsters are fighting each other!
<string>That's my partner!
<string>Yeah! Right on target!
<string>Excellent use of the terrain!
<string>I'll save this for later, then!
