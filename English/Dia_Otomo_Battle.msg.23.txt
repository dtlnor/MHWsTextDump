<string>Careful we don't get surrounded!
<string>There's a lot of them. Let's get to it!
<string>Capture quest, huh? Remember to bring traps?
<string>Time to bag us a monster!
<string>Capture quests can be a little tricky.
<string>Hafta remember to do this later...
<string>Wanna take a little break to handle this?
<string>We're on the case!
<string>The terrain there... I think we<lf>can use it in combat!
<string>I don't feel so good...
<string>The monster's debilitated!
<string>It's looking weak! Almost there!
<string>We've got it on the ground!
<string>Looks like it's moving to a new area!
<string>A part broke off! We'll have to carve it later!
<string>The monsters are fighting each other!
<string>That's my partner!
<string>Aaand request complete! Kitten's play, really.
<string>Feels nice to help out, huh?
<string>Yeah! Right on target!
<string>Excellent use of the terrain!
<string>Bombs away!
<string>Flying Felyne, incoming!
<string>Time to get my paws on some plunder.
<string>Do your thang, Plunderang!
<string>I'll patch you up!
<string>I'll leave this for you in case you need it!
<string>I'll save this for later, then!
<string>I'll gather up what you didn't use.
<string>A Flashfly Cage! Use it to blind the monster!
<string>Hey! Get out of there!
<string>Didn't even know what hit 'em!
<string>Alright! Purr-fectly plundered!
