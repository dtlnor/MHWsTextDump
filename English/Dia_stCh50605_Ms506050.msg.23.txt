<string>Heh heh heh, your timing's perfect.
<string>...I smell a sinister plot.
<string>The hunter has a keen nose! Relax, you're gonna<lf>love it.
<string>Because...I invented a new hunting tool for you!
<string>I do love that. So, what does it do?
<string>You'll just have to wait and see.
<string>I wanna tag along on a quest to test it out.<lf>You mind?
<string>Alright. We can head out once I've gotten ready.
<string>Nice work out there! Not too bad for a first run.
<string>Well, you gotta put in a lot of reps for stuff like<lf>this. I'll piggyback on you again sometime.
<string>If it helps with the investigation, I'm all for<lf>it. Just don't push yourself too hard, all right?
<string>Heh heh, well aren't you sweet. I'm looking<lf>forward to it, Hunter.
