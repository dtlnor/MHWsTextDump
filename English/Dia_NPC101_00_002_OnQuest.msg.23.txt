<string>Commencing the quest, by order of the Guild.
<string>OK, Hunter. Eyes keen, minds sharp.
<string>Guild permission granted! Begin the hunt!
<string>Target sighted! Proceed to hunt<lf>the monster at will!
<string>Proceed to carry out the quest at will!
<string>We've been asked to capture the target. Be sure<lf>not to slay it unintentionally.
<string>Our task is to slay the target. Live capture is<lf>not an option this time.
<string>It sure is nice to help people, don't you think?
<string>A splendid job, as always.
<string>Good work. You're performing in top form today!
<string>Right. Let's head back, then. Or, actually,<lf>shall we continue our survey awhile?
<string>Skillful, as always. Shall we keep up the<lf>investigations while we're here?
<string>We've received supplies. Let's be sure to use them!
<string>Feel free to use all the supplies. No reason to be frugal!
<string>We've been supplied the items needed to capture<lf>the target.
<string>Those supplies will help with this quest.<lf>Let's make use of them.
<string>We've been issued additional supplies.
<string>We've received new supplies. I'll take the<lf>opportunity to add them to your Seikret's pouch.
<string>I'll take back those supplies.
<string>Don't ever hesitate to use up these supplies.
<string>The monster dropped something!
<string>It appears the monster has left a piece behind!
<string>Don't forget that small monster carvings are just<lf>as useful as those from large ones.
<string>I gathered a few things myself.<lf>Check your item box later.
<string>The materials we are searching for should be here.
<string>I'll be on reserve at camp.
<string>I'll return to camp. Be careful out there.
<string>I'm going to regroup at camp. Alert me if you need anything else.
<string>I'll be your support.
<string>I apologize for the wait!
<string>I'm sorry, were you waiting long?
<string>It's dangerous here! You need to run!
<string>Amazing! This will surely lead to a breakthrough in<lf>our research. I owe it all to you and this monster.
<string>Coloration...mm-hm. Texture...yup. Nutrition<lf>levels...mmm.
<string>What a fascinating sound it makes while asleep.<lf>My next report, perhaps?
<string>H-Hey! What are you doing!?
<string>Is that egg for delivery? Let's see it safely back<lf>to camp, then.
<string>It seems not everyone is a fan of science!
<string>The egg!
<string>Egg safely delivered. The Guild's researchers will<lf>handle it from here.
<string>Let me know if you want to summon your Palico.
<string>The monsters hear the vibrations of the fulgurite<lf>mantling Rey Dau and know to steer clear.
<string>That was quite the scare. I certainly didn't expect<lf>to run into a monster like this. I'm grateful to you.
<string>Most cephalopods are incredibly intelligent.<lf>We may even be able to communicate with them!
<string>Gemma made it quite clear that she had no interest<lf>in seeing this one again.
<string>Thinking about Arkveld always sends my thoughts<lf>spiraling. Where DOES life come from, indeed?
<string>That fish sure is peculiar. I want to study it!
<string>Perchance, is that fish possibly...?
<string>That endemic creature's holding something shiny.
<string>We should give our thanks to this creature.
<string>Something's coming this way! Outside, quickly!
<string>Something's coming this way! We need to go!
<string>I'm so glad I came here.
<string>Something's happening!
<string>Hunter, look!
<string>Do you hear something?
<string>Ah, I see.
<string>Ahh, this is nice.
<string>They all look so tasty!
<string>So tasty!
<string>Don't worry, I'm sure it's still tasty!
<string>Ooh, hold on, let me measure that one.
<string>That's quite a rare species.
<string>See that dark shade? It's a Black Windrustler!<lf>What a lucky sight.
<string>It's a Hymstrigian. Listen—you can hear how its call<lf>differs from an ordinary Amstrigian.
<string>An Azure Rufflizard! Similar to an Ember Rufflizard,<lf>but note its shade and slightly larger size.
<string>It's a Regal Jewel Scarab! Cover yourself in a hundred<lf>of these and you'll look like royalty.
<string>A Dazzlewing! You can tell from its majestic crest<lf>and tail that it's a mature male specimen!
<string>Oh, a Sandstar! It's extremely sensitive to sound—<lf>approach carefully or it'll run for the hills.
<string>What a beautiful Peony Sparklerjelly. That one's<lf>a female. How captivating.
<string>I can't believe it—a Prism Hercudrome!?<lf>What a miracle to behold!
<string>Good luck, Hunter! I believe in you!
<string>This is it... Anything could happen!
<string>Could this be my chance to encounter unknown<lf>creatures? Ooh, so exciting!
<string>Since you're here, you should go for the gold!
<string>What a victory! That wasn't even a contest.
<string>That was incredible. You put all your experience<lf>to good use!
<string>Outstanding! I couldn't take my eyes off you!
<string>Whew, I'm still sweating!<lf>That could've gone poorly.
<string>You almost had it! Better luck next time.
<string>Well fought! You'll get it next time.
<string>You're capable of more. I'm sure of it.
<string>Sometimes luck just isn't on your side.
<string>So you're a first-rate fisher, too!
<string>What a feat! Your skill with capturing puts<lf>others to shame.
<string>You can do it!
<string>Go and give it everything you've got!
<string>Looks like something's brewing at the Grand Hub.<lf>Shall we have a look?
<string>A special event? We don't want to miss that!
<string>Let's be on our way.
<string>OK, let's head out!
<string>Commencing the quest. Are you ready?
<string>Guild-authorized target sighted.<lf>You may begin the hunt.
<string>OK, initiating the quest. Get ready!
<string>Fine work, Hunter. Ready to head back?
<string>I'm glad you made it through safely.
<string>Quest complete! Well handled, Hunter.
<string>It would be a waste to call it quits here.<lf>I wouldn't mind doing a little more exploring.
<string>Right. As long as we have the time,<lf>let's continue the investigation.
<string>We have supply items from the Guild.
<string>Supply items have come in from the Guild.<lf>Help yourself.
<string>Talk about unfriendly environments...<lf>I hope the weather relents soon.
<string>I'm still not used to these Inclemencies.<lf>At least there's the Plenty to look forward to.
<string>The Guild hasn't authorized that target.<lf>Let's look for another one.
<string>Hold on. That monster hunt hasn't been authorized.
<string>We don't have clearance for that monster.<lf>Why don't we seek out a different quest?
<string>Careful! The weather's changing rapidly!
<string>The weather's turning against us quickly.<lf>Be on guard.
<string>Our target is going to exit the locale!
<string>I've located a target of interest.<lf>Check your map.
<string>Oh, nicely done!
<string>Are you OK? Make sure you stock up on<lf>whatever you need.
<string>You'll have another chance.<lf>I'm just glad you're all right.
<string>That was quite the ordeal.<lf>Let's make sure you're ready for a rematch.
<string>Success is built on failure.<lf>Now then, let's prepare your gear and strategy.
