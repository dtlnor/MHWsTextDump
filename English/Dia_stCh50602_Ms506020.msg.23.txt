<string>It is you, Hunter. Auspicious timing. There is<lf>something I would speak with you about.
<string>Our masons sighted an unfamiliar monster while out<lf>gathering stone. I thought you should know.
<string>I see. Any details you can share?
<string>Yes. They mentioned being blinded by a flash,<lf>before finding the stone they gathered stolen.
<string>Some of those affected by the light reported a<lf>terrible dizziness. I fear worse harm may follow.
<string>It feels almost as if it is lying in wait for<lf>us, knowing that we quarry during the Fallow.
<string>A dizzying flash... I can think of a likely<lf>suspect. Either way, we'll need to take action.
<string>Are you comfortable leaving this matter to us?
<string>To be honest, it would be a relief. My apologies<lf>for the bother, and my thanks.
<string>I see. Going off of Zatoh's account, I would<lf>suspect we're dealing with a Gypceros.
<string>Agreed. But the complete lack of other sightings<lf>feels unnatural. That's what gives me pause.
<string>If there's any clue here, it's that only people<lf>involved in mining stone have encountered it.
<string>You're right... Ah! Didn't he mention that they<lf>only quarry stone during the Fallow?
<string>Might the Gypceros only be active in this region<lf>during that particular season?
<string>It's certainly possible. Alright, we'll time<lf>our investigation with the Fallow, then.
<string>Understood. Please be careful when the time comes.
<string>Our investigation confirmed that it was a monster<lf>we call Gypceros disrupting your miners' work.
<string>You mentioned stolen ore. These monsters<lf>often collect shiny objects for their nests.
<string>I see. It seems that is a trait we share in<lf>common with these monsters.
<string>That, and the fact that they only show up in the<lf>area during the Fallow.
<string>Hah. With so much in common, I begin to feel a<lf>strange sort of kinship...
<string>Tell me, is there some way to coexist in peace<lf>with these monsters?
<string>The first thing would be not to attract their<lf>attention. Be careful of noise and shiny metal.
<string>They aren't hostile to us by nature. They should<lf>make decent neighbors unless actively provoked.
<string>Understood. This marks another valuable lesson we<lf>have learned from you. I will inform our masons.
<string>I thank you. Come back anytime. The people of this<lf>village will gladly assist where we are able.
<string>And they have my thanks in advance. If anything<lf>else comes up, just let me know.
<string>There it is! It seems we were right about the<lf>Gypceros only appearing during the Fallow.
<string>Further study is needed if we're to secure<lf>the area for mining. Hunt authorized!
<string>Understood!
<string>A Gypceros! Alma was right, it seems they do only<lf>appear during the Fallow.
<string>In order to secure the area for mining and further<lf>investigation, the Guild authorizes this hunt!
<string>Got it!
