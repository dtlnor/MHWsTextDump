<string>Good day to you, Hunter. I hope all is well!
<string>Did you have a message for Fabius? ...Hm?<lf>You wanted to talk to me?
<string>I see! Then let me share just a few of Fabius's<lf>finest accomplishments with you.
<string>I had heard talk of it before coming, but I admit<lf>I'm still adjusting to the unique climate here...
<string>No, no! That wasn't a complaint! Just, er... Just<lf>a declaration of my intent to overcome it!
<string>...Phew.
<string>What do you think I'm lacking in order to<lf>begin to surpass Fabius?
<string>I suppose...overwhelming impact?
<string>Yes, impact, and a confident air.<lf>That is where I must set my sights!
<string>Fabius has aided me in more ways than I can count.<lf>I exist as I am today solely thanks to him.
<string>I spend my days pondering how I might surpass him,<lf>but...perhaps I merely want for him to rely on me.
<string>It is an honor to meet you, Hunter. My name is<lf>Rex. I serve under Fabius's command.
<string>Technically, this is not our first meeting...<lf>I saw you on your earlier visit to Fabius.
<string>But I am glad for the chance to finally speak with<lf>you. I look forward to working with you.
<string>Fabius is a truly great man.
<string>He has long served as a trusted pillar of the<lf>Guild, but at his core, he is an ace hunter.
<string>And a biologist of much renown, besides! In other<lf>words, a spectacularly accomplished person.
<string>By Fabius's command, I am dedicating my all<lf>to keep watch over this land.
<string>Should anything unusual occur,<lf>you will have my immediate report!
<string>This has always been a fiercely cold place, but<lf>the chill bites even deeper as of late...
<string>No, no! I wouldn't think of complaining! This is<lf>simply...one more trial to overcome... But—
<string>Wah-<ITALIC>CHOO!</ITALIC>
<string>Truly admirable work, Hunter!
<string>As a devotee of Fabius, cultivating one's skill<lf>with the lance is a prerequisite.
<string>Cobb and I have been practicing day<lf>and night to hone our abilities, but...
<string>The more I train, the further away from Fabius I feel.
<string>I understand that a deep understanding of biology<lf>is a requisite for any hunter. I do...
<string>But it's always hard not to let improving my<lf>hunting skills distract me from my studies.
<string>Though, since coming here, I feel as though my<lf>priorities have begun to shift somewhat.
