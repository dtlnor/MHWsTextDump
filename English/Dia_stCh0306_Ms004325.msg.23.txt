<string>This must be Suja, right?<lf>Where we'll find the Allhearken?
<string>We should seek out the Allhearken.
<string>This looks like it leads all the way up.
<string>It's so strange here... You'd hardly know we<lf>passed through all that cold.
<string>The weather here is milder, for some reason.

<string>If you told me this place was protected by<lf>some secret aegis, I'd believe it.
<string>Look over there! That's where we came from.
<string>Can you even believe we made it across that?
<string>Hm? Are you the ones?
<string>Mm? The scent of Wyvern Milk is thick with you...<lf>Are you Keepers, then?
<string>I was just thinking that we haven't seen you all in<lf>a moment. Or a few years, by your human measure.
<string>Is the path open, then? Oh, that's nice. There<lf>was a dreadful blizzard until just recently.
<string>No, ma'am. We've come from the West.
<string>Oh... Ohh! No, then... You're the birds! Ohh,<lf>welcome! Welcome!
<string>Oh dear, oh dearie me, you've made it back to us.<lf>At the end of a long journey, and a longer divide.
<string>I have been awaiting you. You are the hunter, yes?
<string>The Allhearken has informed me of your coming.
<string>Where is the Allhearken?
<string>At this time of day, likely out harvesting food.
<string>The Allhearken is likely out harvesting food<lf>at this time of day.
<string>Might you be...the "hunter"?
<string>I am. You know of us?
<string>I know only that the Allhearken spoke of birds<lf>bound our way.
<string>Please, forgive my poor manners. I am responsible<lf>for Suja's defenses.
<string>You carry a relic on your back, but I pray your<lf>heart is one unclouded.
<string>You carry a relic on your back, but I pray your<lf>heart is one unclouded.
<string>Are we done here, then?
<string>Who is doing the harvesting up top?
<string>The Allhearken said she would.
<string>Once we're done, let's head up and help the<lf>Allhearken.
<string>We should pick up the pace then, hmm?
<string>A nice harvest, this.
<string>Mm. Puts the heart at ease.
<string>I have a feeling the birds will come today.
<string>I wonder what sort they will be.
<string>What do you suppose our birds<lf>will want for supper?
<string>Best we readied a few options.
<string>Pardon me, sir. I'm looking for the Allhearken?
<string>Oh, yes. You'll find her just up this hill.
<string>Thank you.
<string>The Allhearken is just up this hill.
<string>Don't be shy, now. Go on ahead.<lf>You'll know the spot.
<string>Wow, we're really high up.
<string>The Allhearken must be here somewhere.
<string>Whew... That takes care of the Base Camp.
<string>We should talk with the people here<lf>while we have the chance.
<string>I'm glad you all made it here safely.
<string>Well, thank you for making space for us.<lf>It was very kind of you.
<string>If you don't mind me asking, what's that<lf>building over there for?
<string>What, that? Oh, 'tis nothing special.<lf>We use it for melding.
<string>If it is of interest to you, we could find<lf>someone to tell you about it.
<string>While I have you—if it pleases you, the Allhearken<lf>has asked if you would repast with us.
<string>Please us? We'd be completely honored!
<string>Tell the Allhearken we accept her invitation<lf>with the greatest pleasure.
<string>We will be gathering to repast further up the slope.
<string>Hold on. What about the Allhearken's invitation?
<string>No, they've invited us to eat with them.
<string>Oh, my. You're here early. My apologies, child,<lf>could I ask you to wait just a moment longer?
<string>Hunter, do you mind if we take a peek inside?
<string>Wyverian technology never ceases to amaze—<lf>and more often than not, it comes in handy, too.
<string>Please? This is my itch. Let me scratch it.
<string>You should go for a walk.<lf>It's a beautiful night.
<string>Gemma's not here. Guess I'll come back later.
<string>Good evening. I was invited to a meal.<lf>Where should I be headed?
<string>Up the hill and then to your left, friend.
<string>Thank you.
<string>Head up the hill, then look to your left.<lf>The Allhearken is waiting for you there.
<string>Welcome. This way.
<string>Please, have a seat.<lf>We've been waiting for you.

<string>Thank you for the meal.
<string>It was really delicious.
<string>That warms my heart to hear.<lf>Shall we converse before you go?
<string>What terrible disaster struck Wyveria?
<string>Where has Arkveld gone?
<string>Tell me about Suja.
<string>(End Conversation)
<string>There's something we want to know. It's about<lf>the calamity Wyveria brought on itself.
<string>To be honest, I think most, if not all of us<lf>can venture a healthy guess.
<string>Yes. No doubt you can.
<string><COLOR FF0000>#Rejected#</COLOR> Dia_stCh0306_Ms004325_0130_t013a
<string>Once the threat of war loomed at their gates,<lf>they created a Guardian to be their savior—
<string>unaware that it would spell their own demise...<lf>Or perhaps they did know.
<string>That Guardian fell dormant but remains alive<lf>to this day.
<string>There's a Guardian out there that<lf>can eradicate whole civilizations?
<string>Did you witness the capital's fall yourself?
<string>No. I merely hear the whisperings of history.
<string>Yet, they are as clear as the sounds of yesterday.
<string>I want to see what Arkveld becomes.<lf>But...we have no idea where it's gone.
<string>In that case, Nata, let me ask you one question.<lf>What do you make of hunters?
<string>Huh? I think...they're incredible!<lf>I'd love to be more like them...
<string>Tracking monsters, working out their<lf>behavior— Oh!
<string>Of course! If we want to learn about Arkveld,<lf>we need to learn more about Guardians first.
<string>And where are Guardians born?<lf>Where are they found? Wyveria.
<string>Sounds like we need to go into the ruins and<lf>continue our investigation there.
<string>Suja is such a mysterious place. The weather is so calm here—<lf>it's so unlike the other regions.
<string>Is there some trick to it?
<string>There's no trick at all. It's actually quite simple.
<string>Our Wyverian ancestors left the capital, discovered<lf>a land of calm, and planted their lives here.
<string>Where they took root, we continue to grow.<lf>Nothing more.
<string>You're too humble. Even as an outsider, I can see<lf>the care and love you've poured into this village.
<string>It's beautiful here. Truly.
<string>A Wyverian can endure many more seasons than a human.
<string>Perhaps that is the "trick" to how much we've grown.
<string>We should be on our way.
<string>Thank you once again.
<string>It has been a great fortune to meet you.
<string>I'll find Arkveld, no matter what it takes.
<string>May the path you find be the one you seek.
<string>Alright, let's return to the Base Camp in Sild.
<string>So...you think you'll just...enter Wyveria<lf>and study the Guardians?
<string>That's right. There's still so much about<lf>them we don't understand.
<string>Uncle, I know the Keepers have<lf>spent a thousand years here.
<string>But curiosity is important...and powerful.<lf>I've learned that traveling with my friends.
<string>The Allhearken said it too:<lf>Go forth and stand witness.
<string>We'll find Arkveld. Together.
<string>Yes... Yes, I know you will.
<string>There are places in the capital where the Wyvern<lf>Milk has crystallized, blocking the way.
<string>I'll go with you and clear it out so you can<lf>access the capital's lower reaches.
<string>Oh, hello, Hunter. Quite a view, isn't it?
<string>Aren't you cold, Nata?
<string>I'm OK. The two of us were just<lf>talking about Arkveld.
<string>The Allhearken said she didn't know<lf>what would become of it.
<string>But we can figure it out, right?
<string>You've taught me time and time again, Hunter...<lf>Things in nature happen for a reason.
<string>If it decided to leave Wyveria,<lf>if it realized it needed to eat...
<string>There has to be a reason for it.
<string>Right. And together we'll find it.
<string>I won't let you down! I may still be learning,<lf>but I'll do my part.
<string>Oh, there you are.
<string>I've been having a look around. As this kind<lf>person just explained to me...
<string>This is called the Auscaltary. It's where<lf>the Allhearken prays.
<string>To the people of Suja, it's a very important place.
<string>Must be, if they use it for prayer.
<string>Mm-hmm. We live in such a fascinating world.<lf>For every place, there's a different treasure...
<string>And for every treasure, there's a need that it fills.
<string>Olivia, Athos. Nice night, isn't it?
<string>All the nicer when you've just taken on a monster<lf>of a monster. We make a pretty good team.
<string>Something tells me it's not your first time<lf>wrangling with something that size. Hm?
<string>And I hear you're a bit of a nomad.<lf>Going from one place to another.
<string>Any particular reason why?
<string>Sorry to disappoint, but no. What about you?<lf>What's your story?
<string>Me? I suppose there's an idea in<lf>my head of what I should be.
<string>So I try to do what I think is right, hoping it will<lf>take me one step closer to it.
<string>That sounds like it requires a lot of discipline.
<string>It can sometimes...
<string>But then I look at you and think, "What's it all for?<lf>Maybe I'd be better off living free as a bird..."
<string>Oof. Look at me getting all "deep."<lf>Must be this clean mountain air.
<string>I don't know about you, Hunter, but I'm starting<lf>to think we're in over our heads.
<string>Think we should pack it in?
<string>Yeah, right. After coming this far? Pfft.
<string>You know, Hunter, when breakin' a big rock,<lf>I use a tiny wedge.
<string>When dealing with something difficult, I treat it<lf>like a big ol' rock. I get to hammering away at it.
<string>I just keep hammering away, and eventually<lf>that little wedge does its thing.
<string>I believe in that wedge, just like I believe in you.
<string>Hope I don't let you down.
<string>You? Pfft. Never. Hunter, we may not be much—<lf>just a couple of sputters in the aether.
<string>But we can move mountains.
<string>Ah, back to business, yeah?

<string>So, you carry a weapon with you...
<string>I was a bit nervous when the Allhearken<lf>spoke of your coming.
<string>That which you bear seems slightly different from<lf>what I've studied in the histories.
<string>Though different how, I couldn't say...
<string>That which you bear seems slightly different from<lf>what I've studied in the histories.
<string>Though different how, I couldn't say...
<string>How much do you suppose our birds will eat?
<string>We've picked so many, I don't think<lf>there's any reason to worry.
<string>I wonder if they'll like Wyvangos...
<string>We managed to harvest a whole feast for the birds.
<string>I do hope they enjoy them.
<string>I haven't seen any of the Keepers in some time.
<string>The Allhearken mentioned that it seems a lot has<lf>happened to them lately.
<string>I do hope they're all well.
<string>I hope the Keepers are doing all right.
<string>Yes, I wonder just what's happened to them.
<string>Ahh, it's you. Have you finished supper?
<string>No, I'm on my way to eat now.
<string>I see, I see.
<string>So much function packed neatly into a small space.<lf>What a marvelous hut.
<string>I suppose it's that technology that<lf>drove back even the lord of ice.
<string>You must be our visitors from the western lands.<lf>This place is called the Auscaltary.
<string>It is a place of great importance to us.
<string>The Allhearken plucks whisperings from the winds<lf>here in the Auscaltary.
<string>Ahh, then you are the "hunter"?
<string>Your pardon, please. I am one who<lf>watches over Suja.
<string>You've been gracious hosts.
<string>And you, I see, soar with wings<lf>fit to rein the roughest gale.
<string>Good hunter. You soar with wings<lf>fit to rein the roughest gale.
