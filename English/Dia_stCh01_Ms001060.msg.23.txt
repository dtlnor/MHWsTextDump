<string>Ooooh, this is just WAY too exciting!
<string>Nata, we should get ready.
<string>You think they might know about my village?
<string>We can ask, but remember to be respectful.
<string>OK!
<string>Now's not the time for detours.
<string>Thank you so much for your help. I'm truly<lf>grateful.
<string>You can rest assured that I'll see a record of<lf>your heroism delivered to the Guild!
<string>You really saved our tails, Avis Unit Hunter!
<string>Next time you're in a pinch, it'll be my turn to<lf>come to the rescue. Count on it!
<string>Whew, that was scary... And <ITALIC>embarrassing.</ITALIC> I'm in<lf>charge of tending to the wingdrakes!
<string>I'll be ready for next time, though. ...Assuming<lf>there is a next time!
<string>Whoa, it's the Avis Unit Hunter! Thank you SO<lf>much for earlier!
<string>I used to think I was pretty strong, but compared<lf>to you? There's no contest.
<string>Greetings, Hunter. I'm happy to inform you that we've<lf>laid the groundwork for our monster studies in this region.
<string>And we can always use the assistance of a capable<lf>hunter like you, wink wink nudge nudge.
<string>Here, take this Field Guide.
<string>It's for recording information about the monsters you encounter.<lf>Not that I need explain that to one such as yourself.
<string>You'll note that it's current. I took the liberty<lf>of filling it in based on your reports.
<string>Carry on, then. I know you won't let us down.
<string>Thanks for savin' my whiskers, Hunter.<lf>I wasn't sure I would make it to Base Camp!
<string>But now, here I am! Ready with the on-the-go<lf>must-have ingredients a hunter hungers for!
<string>That's sort of my job, ya see—<lf>I'm a purrveyor. Call me Tom!
<string>The better you eat, the more health and stamina<lf>you'll have. Makes things easier out there!
<string>Here. I'm settin' ya up with a little thank you.<lf>What d'ya say to whippin' somethin' up?
<string>Got a minute?
<string>Sure. What can I do for you?
<string>Tell me more about yourself.
<string>What do you do for fun?
<string>(Open the Quest Board)
<string>(End Conversation)
<string>Somehow I managed to be the last person to hear this,<lf>but is it true you studied under Fabius at the Academy?
<string>What? We've been traveling together all this time<lf>and you're asking me NOW?
<string>But, yeah, I did. Though our fields were different.<lf>His being biology.
<string>Either way, by the time I finished, he'd roped<lf>me into joining his research team.
<string>Actually, that's when we found Nata,<lf>when we were out doing research.
<string>Your field is cultural anthropology, right?
<string>Uh, yeah... Yeah, that's right.
<string>I started reading up on all kinds of cultures and eras.<lf>Then that got me into studying lots of languages.
<string>Which motivated me to further<lf>my education and now, here we are!
<string>What sort of things do you do for fun?
<string>Fun?
<string>Not sure it meets one's definition of "fun,"<lf>but I like to dabble in archaeology.
<string>People, for the most part, haven't changed much throughout<lf>the ages. But I'm drawn to the relics that tell their stories.
<string>I've unearthed so many strange and unusual<lf>curiosities with such fascinating history.
<string>They might not look like much, but if we ever get<lf>the chance, I'd be delighted to show you sometime.
<string>I'm glad you're on the team.
<string>Well, thank you. I feel the same.
<string>Sounds like we're going to that village.
<string>Uh... Yeah...
<string>I hope someone there can help us...
<string>How are you holding up?
<string>The Support Team is here.
<string>What are you into lately?
<string>(End Conversation)
<string>How are you holding up?
<string>I'm OK... I guess.
<string>So... does that weapon ever get too heavy?
<string>Not really. I'm used to it.
<string>I'm surprised you don't fall over backwards.
<string>The Support Team's here.
<string>Uh-huh... You know, we don't have<lf>Felynes where I come from.
<string>I couldn't believe my eyes the first time I saw one.
<string>So many things are new to me...<lf>And so many different kinds of people...
<string>I was so scared when I first reached the surface<lf>and there was nothing but sand.
<string>But after I met Alma, I wasn't so scared anymore.
<string>So, uh, what've you been into lately?
<string>I really like...is it "cheese"?
<string>I tried it for the first time in your country...<lf>It was delicious.
<string>We'll have to scrounge some up.
<string>Thank you.
<string>Let's talk again soon, OK?
<string>OK.

<string>Ready to go?
<string>Let's head out.
<string>I need a little more time.
<string>Great! My village awaits.
<string>No problem at all. Take your time!
<string>That was a nice bit of work. I'm glad to see<lf>you and the Support Team are safe.
<string>Oh, I have some news for you. A massive forest<lf>was found a ways out from here.
<string>Now that the Support Team is in, we're thinking<lf>we might begin our investigation there.
<string>Still, I'm sure we'll see each other before long.<lf>Wherever we are, let's give our all for the mission.
<string>Will do. You take care.
<string>I heard! A Quematrice, they said? Seems there's<lf>quite a bit of overlap in the monsters here.
<string>We're off to the forest now. I'm eager to have a<lf>good look around there.
<string>Who knows? We might just sight<lf>a brand-new species of monster.
<string>Sheesh. I finally get settled here, and we're<lf>pulling up stakes? That's classic Olivia, though.
<string>Safe travels, Werner.
<string>I'll do what I can. Desert, forest... End of the<lf>day, it's all the same to me.
<string>Avis Unit Hunter. I offer my heartfelt thanks<lf>for your aid to the Support Team.
<string>It seems everyone at the Guild is waiting with<lf>bated breath for the chance to speak with you.
<string>Have you selected your weapons?<lf>If not, you can do so in the tent over there.
<string>You can also choose the same type of weapon as both your primary<lf>and secondary. Depending on the situation, that could come in handy!
