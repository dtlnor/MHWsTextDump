<string>We made it. Thank the winds.
<string>I, uh... Thank you.
<string>You're the ones who...arrived recently?
<string>We're from the Westlands.<lf>You're from the village, right?
<string>I'm... yeah.
<string>We followed your trail. I'm glad you're safe.
<string>But the monster just now wasn't the one<lf>that attacked you in the savannah, was it?
<string>It was Sandbears, a great herd of them.
<string>Sandbears?
<string>They're dangerous.<lf>They approached your... your...
<string>You mean our camp?
<string>That's our friend.
<string>I-I see... Hello there.
<string>I wanted a closer look at that camp.<lf>I didn't notice the Sandbears until it was too late.
<string>So it was the Sandbears that destroyed the camp.
<string>I... I've never seen so many of them.
<string>That makes it all the more dangerous.
<string>Let us escort you back to the village.
<string>In that case, would you like to come to my house?
<string>As guests, so I can express my thanks properly.
<string>We'd love to!
<string>Thank you.
<string>Let's go, then.
