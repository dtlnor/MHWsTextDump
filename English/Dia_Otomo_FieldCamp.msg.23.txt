<string>Are those butterflies I see?
<string>We could set up camp there!
<string>That might be a good place to set up camp.<lf>Let's go see.
<string>Could we set up camp here? It sets my fur<lf>on end a little, but it could be handy.
<string>We gotta be careful if we set up camp here.
<string>Think the campsite'll be hidden enough here?
<string>Monsters might not spot a campsite here.
<string>Yep! This is a good place to set up camp.
<string>So many butterflies! It's gotta be safe.
<string>Whoa! I had no idea places like this existed.
<string>I could camp in a place like this forever.
<string>Ohh yeah! Now this is really grilling!
<string>Ahh, I remember using these when I was little.
<string>Roasting it nice and even on the spit like this<lf>always makes meat smell amazing.
<string>Grilled to purrfection, and so tasty!
<string>Hey, it's been a while. You'll get it!
<string>Guess that's the hand-turned experience, huh.
<string>You'll nail the next one, fur sure!
<string>We're gonna grow mushrooms? I can't wait!
<string>What sort of mushrooms do you think we'll get?
<string>I think the mushrooms need a little<lf>more time to grow.
<string>Ooh, I think that mushroom looks ready!
<string>Huh? Look, a rare mushroom's sprouted!
<string>I don't think we're getting any mushrooms...<lf>We'll have to check in better next time.
<string>We were too late for most of these mushrooms...<lf>We can still harvest a few of them, though.
