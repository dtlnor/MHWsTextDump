<string>I heard you helped with the ecological survey out<lf>in the Windward Plains, Hunter.
<string>Oh, the endemic life I captured?
<string>Yes, that! Not exactly what I would call sporting.
<string>Hold on a minute.<lf>I think I'm missing something here...
<string>And what I'm missing is that same help. It's only<lf>fair, after all.
<string>The target location is the Scarlet Forest. I would like<lf>for you to capture the specified species there.
<string>Welcome back. I've confirmed<lf>the endemic life you brought back.
<string>And with that, the Scarlet Forest survey is complete.<lf>He may have pulled ahead, but it's recoverable...
<string>Are you two in some kind of race?
<string>Nrgh!? ...No.<lf>Whatever gave you a silly idea like that?
<string>This is official Guild research, and nothing more.<lf>A race... Ha ha, imagine.
<string>You can find the lovely Dapperwing flitting around<lf>the Scarlet Forest.
<string>They appear green during Fallow, but during the<lf>Plenty they'll molt and become vibrant beauties.
