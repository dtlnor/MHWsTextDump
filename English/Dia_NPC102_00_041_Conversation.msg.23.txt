<string>Gemma? I love her to pieces.<lf>She's like a little sister to me.
<string>No matter where life takes her, I hope<lf>she finds health and happiness.
<string>And that life doesn't have to include me.<lf>I'm just a footnote in her story.
<string>One day she'll meet someone truly special,<lf>and if she forgets about me? That's just fine.
<string>What's the matter?<lf>You want to know more about Fabius?
<string>There are so many stories to tell...<lf>You want something lighthearted or serious?
<string>I've known the man for so long that I'm not<lf>sure which tale is my favorite anymore.
<string>What is it?<lf>Oh, you want to talk?
<string>Well, I do too...as long as it's about you.<lf>Who wants to hear about boring old me?
<string>You're every bit the hunter that Fabius<lf>and Gemma described.
<string>How did they describe you, you ask?<lf>You know...hmm. I can't quite remember.
<string>How are you?
<string>You just love getting into trouble, don't you?
<string>Did you get some rest?<lf>That was a pretty intense "walk," hm?
<string>Though it was a good way to get to know you better.
<string>Nature that's been sculpted by human hands... Hmm...
<string>If you ask me, it's not always in people's best interests<lf>to learn both the reality and the truth behind things.
<string>Knowledge usually gives you more choices,<lf>but it can also be said to reduce them.
<string>There's no way to know until the time comes.<lf>That's just how life is.
<string>Now, go on home to the people who need you.<lf>That's the only goodbye we're doing today.
