<string>Fishing—Life, in microcosm. Drop a line, and you<lf>are in conversation with nature herself.
<string>Where's this coming from?
<string>Be it back home or in a forbidden land, if I see<lf>water, I know what I'm doing.
<string>Is it fishing?
<string>It is! You're a sharp one. And good! I see you<lf>brought a fishing rod.
<string>Though...fishing isn't something one can force<lf>on another.
<string>It's about the desire. The passion! But do give<lf>it a try, if the mood ever strikes you. 'Til then!
<string>Welcome back, Hunter. It seems you enjoyed a bit<lf>of fishing. Oh, I can tell. It's in your eyes.
<string>Fishing is a conversation with nature. <lf>With oneself! Its fruits are far more than just dinner.
<string>Not least, the bond we now share as fisherfellows!<lf>Come! Let us talk 'til dawn of fish philosophy!
<string>How about next time?
<string>I'll hold you to that! It's a promise!
<string>If nothing else, fish offer a multitude of<lf>benefits to the hunt. You'd be smart to stock up.
<string>Fishing starts with finding the right spot. Once<lf>you're there, toss that lure into the water.
<string>Entice the fishies with that, and they'll bite.<lf>Once you get that feeling, get to reeling!
<string>It's easier done than said. Why not give it a try<lf>now?
