<string>Oh, it's you. Sorry, but could I get some help?
<string>Is something bothering you?
<string>There's word of troubling monsters in the Oilwell Basin.<lf>Two of them. We can't get to the mines.
<string>They tried looking for ways around them, or other<lf>spots to dig, but it sounds like they had no luck.
<string>We've been making do with the materials we had on<lf>hand, but our stores are starting to run out.
<string>I'm worried some of the village hotheads'll do<lf>something stupid. Crafting may be our life.
<string>But you need a life to craft. I'm not allowing any<lf>reckless plans. Help me stop them?
<string>Of course. I'm happy to help you persuade them.<lf>I'd like to know how they are "troubling," though.
<string>If a native familiar with the local monsters says<lf>they're unusually tough, they could be aberrants.
<string>If so, closing off the mines won't be enough.<lf>We'll deal with it before anyone gets hurt.
<string>You don't mind? I mean, that would be a huge<lf>help if it really isn't any trouble.
<string>Glad to see you're all right! How was it?
<string>As your people said, there were dangerous monsters<lf>living there.
<string>If mining had continued, they could've grown used<lf>to humans, which would've put the village at risk.
<string>You shouldn't have trouble harvesting stone now,<lf>but tell your people to be careful just the same.
<string>You're really something... I appreciate it. Now<lf>we can finally get back to working at full steam.
<string>The village really does owe you a lot. Let us pay<lf>you back somehow. Don't try refusing me, now.
<string>I'd welcome the help. Thank you.
