<string>These clothes seem soft, mm? Yet they are more<lf>resilient than appearances suggest.
<string>They can even dampen blows<lf>to the body, to an extent.
<string>This same material is used all<lf>throughout the village.
<string>Lately, I've begun to sight monsters while out<lf>observing the Guardians.
<string>Each time, I'm reminded of the day of the attack,<lf>and I just freeze.
<string>Still, all we can do is continue our watch.<lf>Such is the Keepers' way.
<string>When the Wyvern's Wakening comes, the Guardians<lf>become quite unstable.
<string>Ah, pardon. Perhaps it would be clearer to an<lf>outsider if I said they grew more active?
<string>To us Keepers, an active Guardian is<lf>a fundamentally unstable thing.
<string>What is happening inside Wyveria now? The hairs<lf>on my neck have been standing on end.
<string>I'm sure it's nothing. Safest to stay inside the<lf>village today, though.
<string>What...? Arkveld has returned to Wyveria?
<string>Th-That can't be right! What do we... No. No,<lf>this is better left unmentioned to the others.
<string>We've only just finally recovered from the last<lf>time. If they all learned of this...!
<string>Apparently, the path to Suja opened back up<lf>at some point.
<string>It was frozen in a thick sheet of ice. Who<lf>managed to clear it? Was it one of your friends?
<string>I see. Arkveld went on a rampage...
<string>It was always an enigma of a Guardian. Wyveria<lf>is a rich store of energy, yet it still left.
<string>And not just left, but began feeding on flesh.<lf>That thing was beyond the Keepers' control.
<string>What do you suppose it was seeking, in the end?<lf>...That's a question we never even thought to ask.
<string>Greetings, visitors from the outside! I'm observing<lf>the Guardians, the same as ever.
<string>I feel something has changed since you first came,<lf>and yet the days will pass, the same as ever.
<string>It seems more Guardians are waking as of<lf>late. That's not a precise count, just a feeling.
<string>I thought us, the Guardians, and the Dragontorch<lf>were unchanging. But a millennium is a long time.
<string>I wonder if their numbers will keep<lf>growing with time.
<string>The energy inside Wyveria feels highly charged<lf>lately. It makes me nervous when I do my rounds.
<string>I'm not sure how to describe it. Kind of a tingly<lf>feeling. My arms and back feel all, "Tzzt!"
<string>I wonder if it's affecting the Guardians as well.
<string>The energy in Wyveria seems to have calmed back<lf>down. Quite a relief, that.
<string>But you can't lower your guard. It's important<lf>to always stay alert while doing the rounds.
<string>I like to think I understand just how dangerous<lf>monsters can be.
