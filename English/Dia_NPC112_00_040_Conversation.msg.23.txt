<string>My time at the Academy was really<lf>informative and all...
<string>But I learn way more out here on the daily than<lf>I ever did sitting at a desk!
<string>Everything I see here is a new discovery for me.<lf>An endless string of surprises!
<string>I can't believe how lucky I am.
<string>Not many of my classmates can say<lf>they've been out here.
<string>But I wanted to come so bad,<lf>I practically begged the higher-ups.
<string>I sure hope all my classmates<lf>back home are doing alright...
<string>Oh, don't mind me! I'm just reminiscing.<lf>I'm definitely not feeling homesick at all...
<string>I learned a lot at the Academy, but the jury's<lf>still out on whether it's helping me out here.
<string>I'm in charge of all Squad-related things.
<string>It might take me a bit to get up to speed,<lf>but it's good to work with you.
<string>I'll be honest with you—I didn't think I'd actually<lf>get assigned here and I'm pretty nervous.
<string>But! That's no excuse to offer anyone here<lf>anything short of the service they deserve.
<string>I'll be trying my very best not to disappoint.
<string>I'm so glad the Support Team made it back safely.<lf>I was so worried!
<string>Is it true the camp was attacked?
<string>Just thinking about if I'd been there<lf>when it happened...
<string>And here I'd just assumed this place was always<lf>a barren wasteland...
<string>But now look at it!
<string>The weather is going crazy.<lf>...And you're going out there?
<string>Please be extremely careful. We'll all be waiting<lf>for your safe return.
<string>The textbooks didn't prepare me for the monsters<lf>we've been running into.
<string>Even trying to imagine making a decision that'll<lf>decide the fate of an entire region... Impossible!
<string>But you did somehow? You're something else!
<string>Fabius really is out here with us...<lf>I mean, obviously he is.
<string>But he's someone you read about in the Academy<lf>textbooks. We learned his accolades!
<string>I don't know, at some point he started feeling<lf>more like some mythical historical figure.
<string>Fabius spoke to me the other day!
<string>Someone of his standing talking to <ITALIC>me</ITALIC>...
<string>Gore Magala... I know about it, of course. Can't<lf>get through the Academy without hearing about it.
<string>But I've obviously never seen one for myself.<lf>I'm sure few in the world have.
<string>I didn't think much about it, really. But...
<string>Are you actually kind of a big deal!?
<string>Now that I feel more settled in here, I finally<lf>feel ready to start studying again.
<string>Well, I've never been the best multitasker.
