<string>They've been...
<string>...electrocuted.
<string>Let's fall back.
<string>(monster cries)
<string>What's happening!?
<string>What has the Rathalos so worked up?
<string>Erik!
<string>A Lagiacrus! That's the cause of all this!
<string>Here in the East—in the forest, no less!<lf>I can't believe it, the Lord of the Seas!
<string>This is incredible! But, how!?
<string>This is the kind of rush I want the people<lf>to understand!
<string>I want them to know just how diverse<lf>the Scarlet Forest really is!
<string>But...
<string>If we leave things like this, the disruption<lf>to the ecosystem here will only worsen.
<string>It's unfortunate.
<string>However, in the name of ecological preservation<lf>and the safety of nearby settlements, the Guild–
<string>Erik.
<string>Let's capture it.
<string>Alive!?
<string>True, that would allow us to monitor it long-term.
<string>But even so, a Lagiacrus?
<string>That's an awfully tall order for–
<string>But that way works better with your<lf>philosophy, right?
<string>Thank you. That's very kind of you.
<string>Let's go.
<string>The Guild authorizes the capture of that Lagiacrus!
<string>I'll do everything I can to back you up!
