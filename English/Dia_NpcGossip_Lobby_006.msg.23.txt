<string>Laki and Alessa seem to be practicing<lf>together daily now.

<string>Good to hear they're full of energy!
<string>Yeah, that's right, a flower that only blooms<lf>during the night of a full moon.
<string>What does it look like? Is it pointy?<lf>Ovular? Heart-shaped?
<string>I didn't expect to come face-to-face with endemic life<lf>when I walked into the Expedition Command tent.
<string>Apparently it's part of Samin and<lf>Dareel's research.
<string>They really do have free rein<lf>to do whatever they want, huh?
<string>I saw a golden Neopteron amidst<lf>a group of Jewel Scarabs.
<string>Oh, that was probably a Herc.
<string>They always butt their way in as if to show<lf>that they're Jewel Scarabs too.
<string>The Forbidden Lands are gorgeous, aren't they?<lf>Fantastic views practically everywhere you look.
<string>Perhaps. For me, nothing beats the view<lf>I grew up with.
<string>But I suppose it'll be a while yet before you<lf>feel the same way, Quinn.
