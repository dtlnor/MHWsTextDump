<string>If we're studying that creature, I'd best review<lf>similar species... I'll have to get some materials.
<string>Supplemental monster references as well. Maybe<lf>a capture request... Oh, pardon. Did you need me?
<string>Hello. Making progress on your investigation?
<string>...As you can surely see, I'm wading through<lf>materials at the moment.
<string>If it isn't an urgent matter, I ask that it wait<lf>for another time.
<string>To be honest, I was worried that passing my<lf>own task off on a hunter was cheating...
<string>But researchers issuing quests is entirely normal.<lf>As long as the work is done, I see no harm in it.
<string>So I'll be counting on you.
<string>I'm a very straightforward sort. I can only<lf>investigate things from a direct approach.
<string>Samin is a savvier sort. A creative thinker, too.<lf>He'll pass me up in a heartbeat if I slack off.
<string>I will <ITALIC>not</ITALIC> let that happen.
<string>How fares the investigation? If I can assist<lf>in any way, just say the word.
<string>You've been most generous in helping me, Hunter.<lf>Give and take, it's only fair.
<string>Samin's nagging is so incessant... I asked him to<lf>dinner just to shut him up about "proper nutrition."
<string>Surprisingly enough, it was almost fun. I suppose<lf>the occasional break has its benefits.
<string><ITALIC>...Occasional.</ITALIC>
<string>It seems you're quite the unique specimen, Hunter.<lf>I confess, you've surprised me.
<string>Sorry, did I mention? I'm with Endemic Life<lf>Research. Dareel is the name.
<string>I'm still quite green, but I'm studying hard under<lf>the master here. Please do be patient with me.
<string>We researchers have been permanently stationed<lf>here to study the local flora and fauna.
<string>I expect we'll be relying on your aid throughout<lf>that process. You have my thanks in advance.
<string>It's hypothesized that a Quematrice's flame is the<lf>product of highly flammable oil—
<string>But comparing the scale of the blaze to other fire-<lf>wielding species, it's quite limited in its scope.
<string>Perhaps it's purely used as a display of threat?
<string>The Alpha Doshaguma is a fascinating specimen.<lf>A subject you can really sink your teeth into.
<string>I ask that you go in fully prepared, Hunter. For<lf>the research's sake, as much as yours.
<string>What an unbelievable phenomenon, this Plenty...
<string>The White Wraith siphoning energy from Rey Dau<lf>is...unexpected.
<string>True, other species of monsters which feed on the<lf>blood or vital energies of their prey do exist...
<string>But by all accounts, this was something different.
<string>What sort of place is the Keepers' Vigil, I wonder.
<string>As a scholar of ecology, I hope it's a place of<lf>great intrigue.
<string>Ahh, Hunter. Exceptional work, truly.
<string>Even someone like me knows about Fabius.
<string>His achievements alone are impressive, but he was<lf>also one of the forerunners of this expedition.
<string>This may just be my imagination, but the Sandtide's<lf>behavior seems slightly different lately.
<string>Er... No, ignore that. I shouldn't be offering<lf>conjectures without firm data to back it.
<string>If the Dragontorch has contracted the Frenzy,<lf>it could mean that it's a biological construct...
<string>The Dragontorch is the heart of the region's unique<lf>traits... The heart of this land itself, even.
<string>But what is its origin...
<string>This whole land turns on the axis<lf>of the Dragontorch.
<string>That is the extent of our current understanding.
<string>Samin has been nagging me to rest.
<string>But whenever I do, I just wind up doubling up on<lf>reading. Or taking a walk that turns into fieldwork.
