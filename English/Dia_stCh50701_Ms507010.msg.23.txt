<string>Ah, Hunter. I'm so glad you're here. Could I talk<lf>to you for a minute?
<string>Lately, the Vanguard's desert patrols have been attacked<lf>by a sand leviathan unlike any they've ever seen.
<string>It may have felt you were encroaching on its<lf>territory. Have you heard what was different?
<string>It was larger in size. I also heard that it looked<lf>like it was covered in old scars.
<string>I see... From those characteristics, it sounds<lf>like we're dealing with a tempered monster.
<string>A tempered...monster?
<string>One that's weathered countless battles over the<lf>years and grown more powerful. And more dangerous.
<string>If the patrols have attracted one's attention,<lf>they'll be at risk as long as it remains here.
<string>Better to remove that threat before someone gets<lf>seriously hurt. Will you leave this to the Guild?
<string>Of course! Thank you so much.<lf>Please, be careful out there.
<string>The Guild researchers sent to investigate Y'sai's<lf>report confirmed your theory—
<string>They sighted a tempered Balahara in the desert.<lf>It's certain to affect the greater region.
<string>Hunt authorization has come down from the Guild.<lf>Please take care of it as soon as you're ready.
<string>The sand leviathan you mentioned really was tempered,<lf>but it was safely hunted, thanks to your report.
<string>Already, really? Amazing!
<string>That's a huge help. We've only just begun to learn<lf>about monsters. There's still much we don't know.
<string>I hope you'll continue to share your knowledge.<lf>Especially any ways to avoid hunting them.
<string>It's unavoidable in cases of imminent danger<lf>like this one, but the ideal is co-existence.
<string>Sharing any changes you see is part of that. If we<lf>find the signs early, we may have other options.
<string>Understood! We'll be sure to let you know. And<lf>thank you again, really.
<string>Ah, right. Please take this. It isn't much, but we<lf>want to extend our thanks.
