<string>I've received word from Fabius. It<lf>seems he has something for us.
<string>He's asked us to meet him in Suja.<lf>Let's go and hear what he has to say.
<string>I take it Alma has filled you in.
<string>We can speak in more detail on location.<lf>Let us meet there.
<string>Thank you for coming.
<string>Did you want to see us about<lf>something in this area, sir?
<string>A matter surfaced during my<lf>talks with the Allhearken.
<string>I've gathered the others as well.<lf>Wait here a moment.
<string>The Wounded...Hollow, sir?
<string>Yes. It seems that is their name<lf>for a place not far from here.
<string>Indeed. It is a place that beckons to monsters.<lf>And people sought to keep them at bay, long ago.
<string><COLOR FF0000>#Rejected#</COLOR> Dia_stCh0602_Ms006020_0040_t004
<string>But effort does not always bear fruit.
<string>After the city fell, the hollow was overrun by monsters.<lf>And now...it faces change once more.
<string>I take it that's the reason you've called us?
<string>There's been a surge in the monsters visiting the<lf>hollow as of late, though we don't yet know why.

<string><COLOR FF0000>#Rejected#</COLOR> Dia_stCh0602_Ms006020_0040_t011
<string>Also, I have been informed that there is a site<lf>nearby of special significance to your people?
<string>Correct. For us, it is a place of prayer.
<string>A place, then, that you would<lf>no doubt want preserved.
<string>Considering the likely effects of these changes...
<string>You are curious. Go.<lf>Observe it as you will.
<string>You are not ones to treat life with<lf>disregard, nor to take it needlessly.
<string>You have my thanks and my word that we<lf>will proceed with all due reverence, madam.
<string>Avis Unit. You're to survey the hollow. We will conduct<lf>a separate investigation into the surrounding area.
<string>Speak to me again once you have made<lf>the necessary preparations.
<string>I ask that you go and investigate this Wounded<lf>Hollow. Make certain you are prepared.
<string>I'm ready to head out.
<string>I need some time to prepare.
<string>Very good. I wish you safe travels, then.<lf>And stay on your guard.
<string>Fine. Speak to me once you are done.
<string>So this is the Wounded Hollow... Yes, these look<lf>like defensive structures.
<string><COLOR FF0000>#Rejected#</COLOR> Dia_stCh0602_Ms006020_0060_t002
<string>There, a Nerscylla!
<string>But hold on a second. Something about it seems...
<string>Look at how it's moving...<lf>and what's that it's covered in?
<string>Yes, it matches the symptoms of the Frenzy<lf>virus. And if that's true, we can't ignore it.
<string>Designating the target as a threat in need of<lf>immediate intervention. Hunt authorized!
<string>Understood!
<string>When you're ready to continue the investigation,<lf>head to the Quest Counter and accept the quest.
<string>Good work. Whatever I expected to<lf>find here, a Frenzied monster wasn't it.
<string>We should head back to report. Professor Fabius<lf>needs to know about this as soon as possible.
<string>I see. And now the Frenzy, of all things...
<string><COLOR FF0000>#Rejected#</COLOR> Dia_stCh0602_Ms006020_0100_t002
<string>Do you believe the Frenzy Virus is here,<lf>in the Eastlands, sir?
<string><COLOR FF0000>#Rejected#</COLOR> Dia_stCh0602_Ms006020_0100_t004
<string><COLOR FF0000>#Rejected#</COLOR> Dia_stCh0602_Ms006020_0100_t005
<string>Most likely. And I speak from experience when I say<lf>the risks of allowing it to go unchecked are unfathomable.
<string>To your point, sir, our survey of the valley found<lf>multiple species of monsters traveling the area.
<string>And any one of them could be the next<lf>to wind up infected like our Nerscylla.
<string>The Frenzy Virus is among your core areas of study,<lf>Professor. What countermeasures do you suggest?
<string>A Guild oversight operation here in the Hollow...
<string>With the permission of you and the people of<lf>Suja, of course. We would not presume otherwise.
<string>Do as you will. Since the events at the Torch,<lf>some have begun to pine for our prayer site...
<string>It would put my heart at ease to know that<lf>you are minding their safety.
<string>Though...in this time of long-awaited calm, these<lf>new rumblings ring loud. It may not prove easy.
<string><COLOR FF0000>#Rejected#</COLOR> Dia_stCh0602_Ms006020_0100_t014
<string>We will heed the warning well. For the time being,<lf>I will entrust this matter to my men.
<string><COLOR FF0000>#Rejected#</COLOR> Dia_stCh0602_Ms006020_0100_t015

<string><COLOR FF0000>#Rejected#</COLOR> Dia_stCh0602_Ms006020_0100_t017
<string>Um, I'm—I'm honored, sir, but does that<lf>mean you'll be headed elsewhere?
<string>Yes, to tend to our other worry. I will return to<lf>the Academy to prepare a response to the virus.
<string>That begins with a thorough sample analysis.<lf>We need to confirm what it is we're dealing with.
<string>Understood, sir. We'll make a point of<lf>checking back here periodically as well.
<string>Please do. Likewise, I will return<lf>as soon as I have results to share.
