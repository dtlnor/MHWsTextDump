<string>Yo, Hunter! Have your hunts been a bit rough?<lf>Well, Armor Spheres can help buff that armor of yours.
<string>Like a hunter I was close with used to say,<lf>"If your hunts take too long, upgrade that weapon."
<string>"If you're fainting left and right, it's your<lf>armor." Either way, there's no downside to it.
<string>And I put together the setup I need to craft<lf>talismans, too. Whatever you need, I gotcha!
<string>Hey Hunter, got any Artian materials on you?
<string>With enough of those, I may be able to recreate<lf>some weapons of the lost civilization here.
<string>I'm sure as heck eager to try. You game?
<string>You know about mantles, Hunter? They're specialized<lf>tools—grant different effects when you wear 'em.
<string>It's tech developed by the Research Commission. Hey, we're<lf>kinda doing what they did—exploring an unknown territory.
<string>I based my design off theirs. Give it a try, see<lf>what you think.
<string>Hey, Hunter. I put together a new mantle for you.
<string>I think you'll get good use out of this one.<lf>Give it a go.
<string>Got another new mantle for you to try out, Hunter.
<string>I feel pretty confident about it. You tell me<lf>once you've given it a shot.
<string>Finished up another mantle design for ya, Hunter.
<string>You're gonna love this one.<lf>Go test it out for me, yeah?
<string>H-Hunter! Did... Did I hear you're interested<lf>in decorations?
<string>Decos are amazing. Just slap them on your gear,<lf>and they'll grant all sorts of effects.
<string>I could go on and on... I'm sure you'll be obsessed<lf>as soon as you start using them, too.
<string>Ugh, decorations are so <ITALIC>good.</ITALIC> I just want to encrust<lf>you head to toe in 'em.
<string>That being said, here! To kick off the encrusting!

<string>OK, let's crack a few ancient mysteries.
<string>Alright, let's see what we can come up with.
