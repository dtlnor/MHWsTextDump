<string>There it is! Target spotted.
<string>There it is. Ready whenever you are.
<string>Target reached. I'll try to keep up.
<string>Alright, let's get to it.
<string>Commencing mission.
<string>Adapting to the situation!
<string>This thing's pretty big.
<string>The big ones always get me fired up.
<string>Does this one seem...small to you?
<string>Hard to judge the distance with small monsters...
<string>Nrgh...! I-I'm sorry...
<string>Falling back... Sorry!
<string>I need to...fall back...
<string>Back in the fight!
<string>Sorry to keep you waiting.
<string>Bomb, placed and ready.
<string>Bomb placed. I'll leave the rest to you.
<string>Placing a trap here.
<string>I've set a trap just to be safe!
<string>Let me help you out.
<string>Some quick first aid.
<string>Here, you can do it!
<string>Time to power up.
<string>Deploying a flash!
<string>Watch your eyes, throwing a flash bomb!
<string>I love a well-timed sonic bomb!
<string>I'll give this one an earful!
<string>One stinker, heading their way!
<string>Dung pod out. Let's make them move!
<string>You have to hang on!
<string>Please, try to hang on!
<string>What's wrong? This isn't like you!
<string>Incoming! Get clear of it!
<string>Not good... Fall back!
<string>You're a lifesaver.
<string>I owe you for this.
<string>I'm in your debt.
<string>We're nearly there.
<string>The target is on its last legs... What's our move?
<string>Yes, gotcha!
<string>Now! Hit it with everything!
<string>Monster down! Let's go!
<string>Now's our chance!
<string>I've mounted it! I'll do what I can!
<string>I'm on top of the target!
<string>You broke it. Nicely done.
<string>Part broken. That's how it's done!
<string>Let me give you a boost.
<string>Attack Up, let's jam.
<string>Here, an attack boost. Go wild with it!
<string>Here, dance to the music!
<string>Hardening your defenses!
<string>Defense Up, let's rock.
<string>A song for your defenses!
<string>Defenses hard as a rock, get out there!
<string>Stamina boost, no stopping!
<string>A jaunty tune for your stamina!
<string>Your stamina is up. Sprint all you like!
<string>Stamina boost done. Give it your all!
<string>This will negate any wind pressure!
<string>Wind Resist, I insist!
<string>The wind can't touch you after this song!
<string>Heh, a little wind can't drown out this melody!
<string>Let my music heal you.
<string>Nothing heals like music.
<string>Tuned ya right up! Looking sharp!
<string>That's a wrap. How do you feel?
<string>Echo Bubble deployed. Make good use of it.
<string>Over here. This Echo Bubble will fortify you.
<string>Hear my horn's roar. Echo Bubble out!
<string>C'mon, horn. For those in the back!
<string>Let's follow their trail.
<string>Phew... Our mark is on the move.
<string>Let's take a moment to check our supplies.
<string>Alright... Let's take stock of the situation.
<string>Well, time to start drafting our report...
<string>Nice teamwork out there.
<string>Yes! We did it.
<string>Time to head back. Wanna get a meal?
<string>I was on a real groove with my hunting horn today.
<string>Nice job out there. Feel free to call me anytime.
<string>Hunts go quickly with you around.
<string>I'll have to try to keep up with you!
<string>That one certainly made us work for it.
<string>That would have been a tough one without you.
<string>I'm falling back now.
<string>I'm heading back. The rest is in your hands.
<string>Good. Now for the next one?
<string>That went smoothly! Let's keep up the tempo.
