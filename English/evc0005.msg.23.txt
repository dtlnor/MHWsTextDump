<string>It's safe now.
<string>Thank the winds...
<string>Um...
<string>Allow us to introduce ourselves. We're—
<string>Wait, wait. Hold on.
<string>Did you really DO that?
<string>There's no way you should have been able to...
<string>So how?
<string>We came because your sister said you were in trouble.
<string>Nona!? Where is she?
<string>She's safe, don't worry.
<string>We'll take you to her, all right?
<string>Hey, you made it!
<string>Any trouble finding us?
<string>None at all, thanks to your flare.
<string>You must be Y'sai.
<string>Please, this way.
<string>Welcome back!
<string>Hey, Hunter!
<string>Back already? Good work!
<string>Hey, your sister's just over there.
<string>She's been worried sick. Hurry!
<string>This is a pretty well-protected spot.
<string>We could do a lot worse for an interim camp.
<string>This way.
<string>Just a quick checkup—
<string>And I'm telling you, we just need some space! She's fine.
<string>But she needs aftercare—
<string>Which we're perfectly capable of.
<string>Nona!
<string>Y'sai! You're OK!
<string>Thank the winds.
<string>Y'see? She's fine.
<string>Now scram. Go!
<string>Back to your stations. They'll fill us in later.
<string>I didn't properly thank you before.
<string>Everything just happened so fast, I...<lf>I didn't know what to say.
<string>Thank you so, so much!
<string>Thank you!
