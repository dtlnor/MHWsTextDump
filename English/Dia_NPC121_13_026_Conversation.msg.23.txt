<string>The motivation these kids have is something else.
<string>It's inspiring...but I worry for 'em a little, too.
<string>...Waiting for the festival feels like forever.
<string>Yabran's been at the frontlines leading the<lf>Oilfolk a long time.
<string>I'm sure some of these hotheaded kids are less<lf>than thrilled at the situation now, though...
<string>That festival high, the buzz in the air...<lf>It never gets old, even after all these years.
<string>Well, we did all we could. If that bears fruit<lf>in the end, that's all you can ask.
<string>Are you kids ready to really cut loose?
<string>Your travels brought you here at the perfect time.<lf>It'd be a waste not to enjoy it.
<string>That's a new face. First time in Azuz, traveler?
<string>Well, you take it nice and easy here, eh? Not that<lf>it's the most relaxing of places just now...
<string>I've told her a hundred times that patience pays...
<string>Did I hear you're the one who helped Maki and<lf>Roqul? Thanks for that.
<string>Maki's got a head on her hot as the Everforge.<lf>Now, how to direct it in the right direction...
<string>Anyone that'd call folks with something to protect<lf>cowards are unimaginative fools in my book.
<string>What'll happen to Azuz...
<string>Maybe Yabran... No, maybe all of us had grown<lf>a bit too conservative.
<string>The young folk have really stepped up lately.<lf>I thought my lot were retirement-bound...
<string>Heh, nice to see we've still got some spark in us.<lf>Been a while since I heard Yabran spout fire, haha.
<string>It's coming up to festival time, but...<lf>something feels a bit off.
<string>Good grief... What is it now?
<string>Right, now how do we fix this?
<string>The Black Flame!?
<string>We managed to pull our toes out of the fire<lf>this time...
<string>All the tribes working together, huh?
<string>Hey. How're things?
<string>We're not doing too bad here. The kids are fired<lf>up. Keeps things lively.
<string>I ain't going out that easily though. I still have<lf>a thing or two to show 'em.
<string>I always thought the Black Flame was something<lf>we couldn't do a damn thing about.
<string>But seeing you and Maki... Makes me think maybe<lf>that was just us making excuses.
<string>There's still not a <ITALIC>lot</ITALIC> we can do...but we'll have<lf>to change that, bit by bit.
