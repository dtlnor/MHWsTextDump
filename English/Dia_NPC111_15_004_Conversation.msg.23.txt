<string>After the village was attacked, we dug graves with<lf>our bare hands. All our tools were lost.
<string>At the time, I didn't mind the cuts on my fingers<lf>one bit. I was alive, after all.
<string>I'll carry on our task here, for our fallen<lf>brother and sisters. I believe it must be done.
<string>Many were injured when the village was attacked,<lf>but that too is a part of our calling here.
<string>Such are the duties we are given as Keepers.
<string>Wyveria experiences periods known as the Wyvern's<lf>Stirring, akin to the season you call the Fallow.
<string>Where are Tasheen and Nata? Did they not accompany<lf>you to the Resting Place?
<string>...You found nothing out of order there? I see.<lf>That is a relief, then.
<string>Go wherever you feel called to, visitor. Surely<lf>it's best if we Keepers are forgotten here.
<string>In a thousand years' time, we will surely have<lf>forgotten you.

<string>What? Then, Arkveld is...? I see... I wonder what<lf>one might call this feeling.
<string>I bear the creature no enmity. I only wish the Guardians<lf>had remained asleep.
<string>I wish the same for the Dragontorch. I wanted<lf>nothing more than for it to go unchanged, forever.
<string>I wanted all to stay just as it was. The Keepers<lf>and their task, the Guardians, the Dragontorch...
<string>Even now, I still don't feel certain of what<lf>I'm meant to do.
<string>And yet... It's strange. I want to show the<lf>friend I lost what we've accomplished here.
<string>I will continue to uphold my duty here. Such<lf>is the Keepers' way.
<string>But I also intend to spend time thinking on just<lf>what that duty is.
<string>The flow of Wyvern Milk has grown chaotic.
<string>Calm has returned to the flow of Wyvern Milk.
<string>I had thought the Dragontorch a thing eternal, but<lf>it was not so... What are we Keepers to believe now?
<string>I wanted all to stay just as it was. The Keepers<lf>and their task, the Guardians, the Dragontorch...
<string>Even now, I still don't feel certain of what<lf>I'm meant to do.
