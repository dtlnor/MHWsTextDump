<string>A sentry...
<string>I guess they really did create<lf>whatever creatures they needed...
<string>So, what kind of monster do you think it could be?
<string>Well, let's see... It would have a keen nose...<lf>enough mobility to navigate any terrain...
<string>It would maintain a broad territory and, by habit,<lf>pursue its prey relentlessly.
<string>At least that's the sort of monster I'd put on guard.
<string>This is called the monster's spoor.
<string>Its shape, size, scent, and placement give<lf>us clues about the monster.
<string>Really...?
<string>It's still fresh.
<string>Between the spoor and the traits a sentry<lf>would require, we try to surmise our target.
<string>An Odogaron. Probably a subspecies.
<string>Get back.
<string>Right. Let's move. Quickly!
