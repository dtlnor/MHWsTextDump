<string>Oh, hello! How's Gemma?
<string>Would you tell her I'm working hard? Please?
<string>I will.
<string>I can't try to do everything alone. What I did<lf>was stupid—I know that now.
<string>But I won't forget how we all came together<lf>like that. I'll remember every second of it.
<string>I think that's important.
<string>Sometimes, I try to figure it out—why the boss<lf>was against me gathering oil for the festival.
<string>But I still don't quite understand...<lf>Maybe I will, one day.
<string>Find your inner fire!
<string>We did another run to gather materials—<lf>this time by working together, of course.
<string>Until now, I've only ever thought about each<lf>festival as it was happening.
<string>But it's something Azuz has been doing since<lf>forever ago, right? Who knows how long back.
<string>I should ask the boss.
<string>Thank you so much.
<string>If you hadn't come along, who knows what would<lf>have happened to me and Roqul...
<string>After all our hard work, how can there be<lf>no Firespring!?
<string>What was the point of any of it?
<string>Gotta step up...!
<string>Thank you so much. I'll never forget today!
<string>I'm starting to look at the world<lf>around me a lot more recently.
<string>Like...how the rocks are formed, why oil wells up.<lf>The color of the sky, where sounds come from...
<string>I want to learn everything I can.
<string>No Firespring...just like the other time...<lf>But...I think we'll be OK this time.
<string>The Firespring...
<string>But we'll be all right. We're working to find<lf>a solution together.
<string>We'll figure this out as one village—<lf>just you wait and see!
<string>I thought for sure that the Basin, the forges,<lf>everything would be gone. Thank you for saving us.
<string>I'm so glad we could all come<lf>together as one village.
<string>Whenever bad things happened,<lf>I used to feel so useless...
<string>But now it almost feels...exciting?<lf>Knowing I don't have to do it alone.
<string>I've started looking into other people's jobs,<lf>regardless of tribe.
<string>I think we all had this idea that the other<lf>tribes' crafts had nothing to do with us.
<string>But I realize now—it was because I didn't try<lf>to think any different.
<string>Since meeting you and Gemma, I've learned so,<lf>so much.
<string>I want to be just like you guys when I grow up.
