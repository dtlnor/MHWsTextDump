<string>Ahh, do you have an interest in bones, too?<lf>You are clearly a traveler of taste!
<string>Did you know that boneworking is a craft that goes<lf>back to ancient times, originating as far back as...
<string>...and so us Bonefolk of today serve as faithful<lf>stewards of that long history, while nonetheless...
<string>I see.
<string>The Bonefolk chief Aida has a discerning eye for<lf>quality but is also a top-tier artisan herself.
<string>And she refuses to be bound to the old methods,<lf>always keeping an eye to the future.
<string>She preserves what must be preserved but isn't<lf>afraid of change. A truly admirable woman!
<string>Welcome, welcome! I'm thrilled to see you show<lf>an interest in the Bonefolk's work.
<string>Today I'll be exploring a new, more efficient way<lf>of tanning leather that Aida recently proposed!
<string>Too heavy a focus on speed can sacrifice quality,<lf>but I'm certain this new method will...
<string>...Wait, are you listening?
<string>Festival tiiime!
<string>Just watch and see what we Bonefolk can create!
<string>Another festival where us Bonefolk have come out<lf>on top! You agree, I'm sure. Right!?
<string>Best in the fest, besting the rest~<lf>It's the Bonefolk again, who could've guessed~
<string>Ahhh, I just love a good festival!
<string>What's going on? Why won't the festival begin?<lf>This has never happened before.
<string>Ah, well. I don't mind a bit of anticipation. It<lf>only makes it that much sweeter when it starts!
<string>Is it today? Will it start today? I sure wouldn't<lf>mind if it started today!
<string>You're free to start anytime now, festival!
<string>O-Our precious village...! What do we do?<lf>What <ITALIC>can</ITALIC> we do!?
<string>Was that festival amazing or what!? I can't<lf>remember the last time I was this excited!
<string>It was a bit of a bumpy lead-up, but the payoff<lf>was absolutely worth it! Ahh, I'm so glad!
<string>Our bone press broke awhile back. Seems one<lf>of the main components went a little screwy.
<string>I wrestled with it for a bit, till someone got sick<lf>of watching me and brought in a Stonefolk guy.
<string>I thought, "Oh great. What's a <ITALIC>Stonefolk guy</ITALIC> gonna<lf>do?" But he got it working in all of five minutes.
<string>It was a surprise to learn we had people this<lf>handy here all along. ...He did fine, I guess.
<string>Hmm, think the Firespring is gonna start soon?
<string>It's like it's teasing us on purpose...
<string>How come the Everforge has been going full blast<lf>this whole time!?
<string>I'm terrified!
<string>Now, times like these, it's important to slow<lf>down, breathe deep, stay calm...
<string>Aah, who am I kidding!? I'm terrified!
<string>And now the Black Flame is here, too!? Gah, what<lf>are we gonna <ITALIC>do!?</ITALIC>
<string>Don't look at me! I'm terrified!
<string>Is it true that you somehow managed to deal with<lf>the Black Flame?
<string>Even the mention of it has my whole body freezing<lf>up. I don't know how you managed!
<string>I was talking to some of the Stonefolk. Y'know,<lf>ore seems like a pretty fascinating material, too.
<string>It may lack the flexibility of bone, but it has us<lf>clearly beat when it comes to durability.
<string>Er, don't get me wrong, I'm only saying there are<lf>some interesting qualities there. As a material.
<string>Something occurred to me when I was chatting<lf>with the Stonefolk.
<string>Sharing our crafting techniques with one another<lf>is actually pretty fruitful.
<string>We may work with different materials, but the ideas<lf>are the same. It's...been educational, I'll say.
<string>And if they're going to just give up their secrets,<lf>I'm not above making use of them. That's it, yeah.
<string>The bone press that broke down earlier got fixed,<lf>but we figured we'd make a few little improvements.
<string>The Oil and Stonefolk have been having a lot of<lf>heated discussions to try and improve things.
<string>Hoo, really lit a fire in all of us. This kinda<lf>thing ain't bad every once in a while!
<string>Kinda irked the other folks have good ideas though!
