<string>Sorry, I'm strictly dry land only. Good luck!
<string>Stay calm down there, OK?
<string>I thought we were goners... But now it's our turn!
<string>Whew... We're still in one piece.
<string>We did it! Now it's time to strike back!
<string>It's slowing down! Claws out!
<string>Pfft! A big target's no biggie for us!
<string>We can take anything if we work together!
<string>That part's weakened now!
<string>You softened it up!
<string>I'll draw its attention!
<string>Don't worry, I'll make sure its eyes are on me!
<string>Mewhoo! It fell off!
<string>Now we can use that against it!
<string>Purrfect shot!
<string>Nice sharpshooting!
<string>That was some great aim!
<string>Purrfect! Direct hit!
<string>That was scary... OK, let's get back to it!
<string>Whew... That's one powerful attack.
<string>Mew... I can barely move.
