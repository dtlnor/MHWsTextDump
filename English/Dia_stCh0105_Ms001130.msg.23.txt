<string>What do you plan to do?
<string>Warn the people of Kunafa and pray that<lf>they believe us.
<string>We've made some headway, too. If the<lf>White Wraith is here in the forest, it's—
<string>But perhaps we leave that for later.<lf>Warning the villagers is more urgent.
<string>Olivia, can I go with them?
<string>I can't bear to think what happened to my<lf>village could happen to Y'sai and Nona's, too.
<string>Nata, to what end does a hunter exist?<lf>What are these weapons we carry for?
<string>It's an answer you have to find for yourself.<lf>And once you do, we'll be here for you, OK?
<string>We should hurry.
<string>What are you doing here? It's nearly Sandtide.<lf>You should take shelter somewhere safe!
<string>Y'sai, listen to me. The Doshaguma have formed a pack<lf>and we think they're heading to your village.
<string>We have to speak to the Elder and convince her<lf>to evacuate the village. There's no time.
<string>Wait, what? The Doshaguma?
<string>This is serious. You've got to believe us.
<string>Hm...
<string>Alright, I believe you. But the Elder...
<string>Wait... I bet Zatoh could convince her! He went<lf>to the oasis to protect the water-bearers.
<string>The oasis. Got it. Thanks!
<string>Be careful out there, Hunter!
<string>Come on! We need to find Zatoh.
<string>Zatoh is at the oasis!
<string>Help! Zatoh's in trouble!
<string>What's wrong?
<string>We were attacked by a horde of sand leviathans!<lf>Zatoh stayed behind to lure them away!
<string>It must be the monsters we saw on the sandship,<lf>the Balahara.
<string>I'll take these two back to the village.<lf>You hurry to the oasis!
<string>On it!

<string>There's too many of them!
<string>I will draw their ire! Cover me!
<string>You got it. Be careful!
<string>Dead ahead!
<string>Here it comes!
<string>Be ready!
<string>Thanks.
<string>I owe you.
<string>Watch out for their mucus!
<string>If we can make it to the rocks,<lf>we may lose them!
<string>Oh no! Quicksand!
<string>Incoming!
<string>Watch out!
<string>Sorry to leave you like that. Where's Zatoh?
<string>Safe. He's taken cover.
<string>OK, good. Now we can focus on the Balahara.
<string>Looks like you've got your hands full!<lf>I'm here to help in whatever way I can!
<string>Good luck to you! And tell Nata there's a place<lf>for him with us in the forest!
<string>Y'sai told me of this, but I paid his words no<lf>heed.
<string>I did not... I never thought it could truly be so.
<string>I've told them that monsters are coming, but<lf>no one believes it.
<string>What do we do? If what happened to my village<lf>happens here, I... What can we do!?
<string>Are you OK?
<string>Zatoh still hasn't returned, and now the Balahara<lf>know his scent.
<string>If we don't intervene, they'll follow him right to<lf>the village. When you're ready, resume the hunt.
<string>Are you OK, Hunter?
<string>Once you're ready, you should resume the hunt.
<string>We did it! I hope Zatoh's OK.
<string>Travelers! Are you all right?
<string>Thank the winds... That encounter was nearly<lf>the end of me. I owe you my life.
<string>That was incredible—back there. I could've<lf>never imagined.
<string>To think a person could stand against a monster like that.
<string>I'm sorry to be curt, but could you listen?<lf>The village is in terrible danger.

<string>There's no time to explain. We'll talk while we ride.
<string>Hunter! Oh...you found Zatoh!
<string>Y'sai is at the Elder's house trying to convince her!
