<string>We've received word from the Astrum Unit.<lf>Do you have a moment?
<string>It seems they encountered something of interest<lf>in the Wyvern's Rest. Let's go and meet with Olivia.
<string>We should start by hearing what Olivia has to say.
<string>Thank you for coming.<lf>Apologies for dragging you out here.
<string>I'll go and gather the others.<lf>Wait here just a minute.
<string>So, Olivia. You've found evidence<lf>of a phenomenon here, too?
<string>I thought this would be of interest to you both.<lf>We found traces of a Lala Barina nearby.
<string>A Lala Barina? What is a<lf>woodland species doing here?
<string>Not sure, but judging by the traces it left behind,<lf>we're dealing with an aberrant case...
<string>So... It's unusual for it to be here... But why<lf>is a Lala Barina being here a problem?
<string>You're asking the right question. And the answer's<lf>right there in your own words. Think about it.
<string>Uh— Oh! I understand!
<string>Lala Barina aren't from around here, so...<lf>to the Guardians, it looks like an intruder!
<string>Exactly, Nata. Considering their nature—and their<lf>former function—there's no telling what they'll do.
<string>And this Barina's strong enough to survive outside<lf>its natural habitat. Probably not your average bug.
<string>So are you asking us to investigate?
<string>Correct. Your knowledge of the Guardians and local<lf>ecology would be welcome assets, if you're willing.
<string>Of course, we'd be happy to join you.
<string>Thank you all... And please, do be safe.
<string>Heading out? In that case,<lf>let's speak with Olivia first.
<string>Let's get moving. Are you ready to go?
<string>Let's head out.
<string>I'd like to prepare a bit more.
<string>Alright, then we're off.
<string>There's still a lot of unknowns.<lf>We'll need to be ready for anything.
<string>Let's head for where those Lala Barina traces were<lf>found. We may find further clues there.
<string>There. That must be it.
<string>Just as I thought. These are clearly not from<lf>a Guardian and most certainly from a Lala Barina.
<string>But what sort of monster could have made<lf>it all the way here? I'm excited already.
<string>Just please don't go running off alone this time.
<string>I said I was sorry about last time.
<string>We may be getting close now. Stay on<lf>your guard as you head in.
<string>Yes, ma'am.
<string>Huh...? Everyone, stop a second.
<string>Over there...
<string>This is not how I saw my day going! But looks<lf>like it was a good call to bring you here.
<string>Was just thinking the same thing.
<string>We'll take the dancing bug; the rest is up to you!
<string>Got it!
<string>Not the best place to do this in...
<string>Let's try luring them down there.<lf>We can use the terrain against them.
<string>Be careful. Fulgur Anjanath fortify themselves<lf>with a powerful electrical current.
<string>Gotta make sure that Anjanath's attacks<lf>don't set off the Wylkrystals.
<string>Synching back up! We'll focus on<lf>the same target from here on.
<string>Understood!
<string>When you're ready, accept the quest<lf>to continue the investigation.
<string>Excellent work, everyone.<lf>Especially given the circumstances.
<string>I can't say I'm a fan of these<lf>monsters evolving this way.
<string>And now, we've got more Guardians waking up...
<string>Erik might have some answers fur us!<lf>Let's head back to Base Camp for now.
<string>Guardians awakening, more powerful monsters<lf>appearing... These are exciting times!
<string>But where have those monsters been until now?
<string><COLOR FF0000>#Rejected#</COLOR> Dia_stCh0701_Ms007030_0170_t003
<string>The energy being pumped out of the Dragontorch<lf>now is...purer. This could be a result of that.
<string><COLOR FF0000>#Rejected#</COLOR> Dia_stCh0701_Ms007030_0170_t005
<string>Huh... Come to think of it, I noticed the forest<lf>had more types of life than before.
<string><COLOR FF0000>#Rejected#</COLOR> Dia_stCh0701_Ms007030_0170_t006
<string>Very perceptive. And what effect might a boom<lf>in plant and animal diversity have on monsters?
<string>More food for monsters...equals more monsters!<lf>Which means...more fighting over territory?
<string>Right! Which raises the likelihood of exceptionally<lf>strong individuals like our Barina emerging.

<string><COLOR FF0000>#Rejected#</COLOR> Dia_stCh0701_Ms007030_0170_t012
<string>I get it... Do you think it could be<lf>happening elsewhere too, then?
<string><COLOR FF0000>#Rejected#</COLOR> Dia_stCh0701_Ms007030_0170_t013
<string>I'd say it's a strong possibility. We'll need<lf>to continue our regional investigations.
<string>In that case, I'd appreciate it if you<lf>could check in on Erik from time to time.
<string>Please do! However, I'll be relocating<lf>to the Scarlet Forest shortly.
<string>If we're to understand this newly diverse ecosystem,<lf>we'll need to diversify our approach as well.
<string>I'll visit you whenever we go to the forest.
<string>You amaze me, Nata. You have<lf>learned much from these people.
<string>Yes. I want to pick up as much as I can,<lf>so that I can share it all with you.
<string>Of course. That's... I'd like that as well.<lf>Please, good fellows. Look after this boy.

<string><COLOR FF0000>#Rejected#</COLOR> Dia_stCh0701_Ms007030_0170_t022
<string>Dealing with the situation comes first...though if<lf>I'm honest, I'm still in shock that I <ITALIC>missed</ITALIC> it!?
<string>I'll have to ask Olivia for an escort out after<lf>I've had a moment to grieve...
<string>A Lala Barina that made it all the way out here,<lf>and a Guardian version of a Fulgur Anjanath...
<string>They both feel familiar at a glance, but are total<lf>mysteries under the surface. Be careful, you two.
