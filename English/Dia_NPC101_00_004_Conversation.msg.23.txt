<string>Are you all right?
<string>Hunter, you're incredible.
<string>Hm? I'm doing all right.
<string>Isn't that weapon heavy?
<string>It's amazing the way people find strength.
<string>I wish I could do the things you can.
<string>You don't need to worry. Everyone looks after me.
<string>But...thank you. It's nice of you to check in.
<string>I'll ride with Gemma to the...<lf>"forest," it's called?
<string>Alma showed me a picture of one in a book—<lf>a place with many trees.
<string>Alma often says that no good comes<lf>of rushing into things.
<string>Do you think so too, Hunter?
<string>......
<string>Rove is going to show us the way.
<string>It should be me, but...<lf>I need to do better.
<string>Rove said he left his homeland to wander.
<string>But why would he do that?<lf>Doesn't he miss his people?
<string>I blamed everything on Arkveld.<lf>I wished it never existed...
<string>But...
<string>I didn't know anything back then, Hunter. Now<lf>I understand that I can't live blind like that.
<string>Hunter, I'm ready to learn.
<string>Not just about Arkveld, but anything the world<lf>is willing to teach me.
<string>Um... I saw a Seikret's eggs in Kunafa.
<string>I only learned what eggs were in the West. It<lf>was a real surprise, at the time.
<string>Alma taught me that they're one of the shapes<lf>life can take...
<string>One day, I'd like to see a new life hatch from<lf>its egg.
<string>Hunter... There's still so much I don't understand.<lf>So much I can't do.
<string>But everything I <ITALIC>can</ITALIC> do, I will. Whatever it takes<lf>to be this land's first hunter.
<string>I'll never forget the sight of that bird as it<lf>took off that day.
<string>Life broke free from its egg and took to the sky...<lf>It feels like the whole ecosystem is telling me so.
<string>If Erik is right, and the quality of the energy<lf>has gotten better...
<string>That's a good thing, then... Isn't it?
<string>I'm going to keep coordinating with the people of<lf>the different villages, same as I have been.
<string>My plan is to focus on the things I can do.
<string>The ecosystem is affected by so many things, but<lf>it also affects everything else...
<string>I can't quite describe it, but it's almost like an<lf>animal itself. ...Just a thought.
<string>Please be careful out there, Hunter.
<string>There's more life now, both in number and kind.
<string>It's amazing. I never knew the world could change<lf>this much.
<string>Frenzied monsters, this Frenzy virus... It's<lf>frustrating to feel like I don't know anything.
<string>Hunter... I want to learn more.
<string>Energy, nature, the monsters... It's all one big<lf>connected system, isn't it?
<string>Hunter. Me, and the Keepers...we're connected to<lf>all of that too, right?
<string>Oh, that's right. Olivia said<lf>she wanted to talk to you.
<string>I'm worried about the Dragontorch.
<string>But we need to investigate a bunch of other spots<lf>first, right?
<string>If the energy can start to flow normally now...
<string>The Dragontorch is... It's really incredible.
<string>Um, Hunter...?
<string>No. I should look into it more on my own first.
<string>Nature is beautiful, but it's also really scary.<lf>This really drove that home for me.
<string>I'm going to go around the villages to learn what<lf>I can, same as I've been doing.
<string>Times like these, it's best to stick with what's<lf>worked before, right?
<string>Alma was looking for you, Hunter.
<string>Hunter... Rove is going to get better, right?
<string>I... I want to be like you, Hunter.
<string>I need to study...so many more things!
<string>Where do hunters fit into the bigger ecosystem?<lf>...I need to keep thinking on that.
<string>Hunter... I can't help thinking that Arkveld and I<lf>are alike.
<string>I know... That's only wishful thinking.
<string>But I feel like that thought is what keeps me<lf>moving forward.
<string>I think...I'll be searching for the answer to<lf>this question until my last breath.
<string>What does it mean for a hunter to take weapon in<lf>hand?
<string>If I notice anything, I'll report it to you.
<string>Do you suppose people will call this place we're<lf>standing "ruins" a thousand years from now?
<string>If the Allhearken is still around, what do you<lf>think she'll tell people about us?

<string>Everyone on the expedition team is so passionate.
<string>It's nice to see smiles on everyone's faces.
<string>The place of prayer is really special, huh?
<string>I wonder what this voice means to the Allhearken.
<string>Father...
<string>I'm so happy that they could start up<lf>this ceremony again.
