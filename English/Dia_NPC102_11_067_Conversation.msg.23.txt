<string>Have you eaten, <PLNAME>? Not yet?
<string>You should come to our house again! It's more<lf>fun to eat in a big group!
<string>You all came from a far, faaar away place.<lf>Right, <PLNAME>?
<string>I never knew people even lived so far from here.
<string>But you came and saved me and my brother!<lf>Just like a hero in a story.
<string>Um, so when I was at your Base Camp, that big<lf>wooden box you had was a "ship," right?
<string>It was like a whole house. Being able to travel<lf>with your house sounds amazing.
<string>When I finish all my chores, the Elder will tell<lf>me stories.
<string>My favorite one is about the great bird, Somult.
<string>Everyone here in the village has a job, you know!
<string>My brother has a lot of jobs. He's a hard worker!
<string>Heya, <PLNAME>! How's Nata?
<string>I hope we can eat cheese together again soon.
<string>Want to know a secret? Seikret think of us riders<lf>as their friends.
<string>That's why they work so hard to help us!
<string>Your Seikret's really smart, <PLNAME>,<lf>but I'm really surprised you get along!
<string>He wouldn't let anyone near him before, you<lf>know! He didn't like being told what to do.
<string>But you could ride him so easily! He must really<lf>like you.
<string>Did you know your Seikret likes children,<lf><PLNAME>?
<string>I practiced learning to ride with him. He was<lf>always patient with me.
<string>Hey, <PLNAME>. Are you and Zatoh<lf>friends now?
<string>Ah! That face... Zatoh makes that face a lot.
<string>We've never had so many people over before!<lf>It was really fun!
<string>Hello, <PLNAME>. I have something<lf>to ask you about your Seikret.
<string>Will you give it a name? A name that only you<lf>will call it?
<string>The lady who tends to the Seikret here says that if<lf>you name them, they'll be your best friend forever!
<string>Nona, go straight to Y'sai and stay with him.
<string>Huh? Um, OK.
<string>Thank you so much! Ahh, that was so scary...
<string>When we were running away, my brother kept<lf>saying, "Th-Th-They can handle it! I-I-It's fine!"
<string>"Th-They'll be f-f-fine! D-D-Don't w-w-orry!"<lf>Just that, over and over.
<string>I think he was real worried about you,<lf><PLNAME>.
<string>You didn't get hurt, did you, <PLNAME>?
<string>Um, did you save our village again?
<string>The other kids are starting their Seikret lessons.<lf>And guess what! I'm the leader!
<string>We tell each other new tricks we learn and race<lf>and stuff. It's so much fun!
<string>The Seikret are all worried... Maybe they'll feel<lf>better if I give them a lot of pets.
<string>Hi, <PLNAME>! Isn't my brother<lf>amazing?
<string>Grandma and I always talk about how happy<lf>we are that he's here.
<string>You all went really, reeeeally far away on your<lf>Seikret, didn't you?
<string>I bet your Seikret got to see all<lf>sorts of new things!
<string>You're so lucky! When I grow up,<lf>I want to travel, too.
<string>Me and the others have an ongoing competition<lf>where we race our Seikret every day.
<string>Playing together is fun, but the races are serious<lf>business, you know. I won't lose!
