<string>You all came from a far, faaar away place.<lf>Right, <PLNAME>?
<string>I never knew people even lived so far from here.
<string>But you came and saved me and my brother!<lf>Just like a hero in a story.
<string>When I finish all my chores, the Elder will tell<lf>me stories.
<string>My favorite one is about the great bird, Somult.
<string>Everyone here in the village has a job, you know!
<string>My brother has a lot of jobs. He's a hard worker!
<string>Want to know a secret? Seikret think of us riders<lf>as their friends.
<string>That's why they work so hard to help us!
<string>Your Seikret's really smart, <PLNAME>,<lf>but I'm really surprised you get along!
<string>He wouldn't let anyone near him before, you<lf>know! He didn't like being told what to do.
<string>But you could ride him so easily! He must really<lf>like you.
<string>Did you know your Seikret likes children, <PLNAME>?
<string>I practiced learning to ride with him. He was<lf>always patient with me.
<string>Hey, <PLNAME>. Are you and Zatoh<lf>friends now?
<string>Ah! That face... Zatoh makes that face a lot.
