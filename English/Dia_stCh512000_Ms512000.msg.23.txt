<string>Hey, Avis Unit. Always nice to meet people I know<lf>I can count on.
<string>The feeling's mutual. What's Vespae Unit up to here?
<string>A few things. As you know, tempered monsters have<lf>been cropping up all throughout the East.
<string>Well, seems this spot's the one exception.<lf>Eyewitness reports have all but dried up overnight.
<string>Interesting. And I'm guessing there are no clear<lf>leads on the cause?
<string>You guessed it. And to top it off, our unit just<lf>got another job dropped on us.
<string>Just as I was trying to map out our priorities,<lf>a person of your caliber walked in.
<string>No pressure, but if you've got a hand free,<lf>would you mind helping us out?
<string>Sure. Always ready to lend a hand.
<string>Sorry, I can't right now...
<string>Yeah? That'd be huge. As thanks, I'll, uh...<lf>I'll buy you a round sometime!
<string>I'll look forward to it. Do you have any<lf>information to get me started?
<string>We haven't finished a full sweep of the middle<lf>or upper strata yet. Might be a good start.
<string>Got it. I'll see what we can find.
<string>Well, good luck. Let's talk again when<lf>you're free, yeah?
<string>It wouldn't hurt to speak with the tribesfolk of Azuz.<lf>Someone might know something.
<string>Maybe it was just my imagination...
<string>Hey, you're not going to believe this, but I<lf>saw someone fighting a monster...in the air!
<string>The guy jumped up and—WHAM—uppercut the<lf>monster with his fist!
<string>Sent 'em flying right over the edge of a cliff!<lf>Can you believe that? I hardly do, and I saw it!
<string>That must have been some brawl...
<string>I recently stumbled upon the remains of a monster<lf>in the upper stratum—a big ol' brute.
<string>I'm just glad I didn't run into the thing while<lf>it was still alive—sheesh!
<string>Judging by the marks left, it took quite a<lf>beating. Maybe the work of a Great Ape.
<string>I thought I was a goner...
<string>Oh, hey, it's you! You really saved<lf>my skin back there!
<string>Like a total rockhead, I walked right into that<lf>monster's nest. Thought for sure I was done for.
<string>Boy was I relieved to discover that the<lf>monster had already been slain.
<string>I have you to thank for that, right?<lf>Wait— Right?
<string>Hmm, no signs of tempered monsters...<lf>Maybe we should try another area.
<string>Come to think of it, didn’t Quinn say<lf>they already checked the Subterrane?
<string>Hm? Something smells different...<lf>Hey, maybe there’s something nearby!
<string>No sign of those monster carcasses...<lf>Should we look somewhere else?
<string>Hm? Wait a moment. That's...
<string>Hey, look over there. That's...
<string>It's a Rathian. Tempered, from the look of her.<lf>Must've had a run-in with something.
<string>A spectacular specimen like this...<lf>Survival of the fittest sure is ruthless.
<string>She passed away in her own nest—natural causes?<lf>Or could it be...
<string>A Gypceros. Looks tempered, but I'm not seeing<lf>any signs of life.
<string>It's possible that whatever did this may have<lf>also been a tempered specimen.
<string>Assuming this wasn't natural causes...<lf>It must've faced quite a formidable foe.
<string>Let's regroup for a second. I've noticed a trend<lf>between all these tempered monsters.
<string>None of them seem to be natural deaths,<lf>but they also show no signs of a struggle.
<string>Right, exactly as you say. I think it's safe<lf>to assume something unusual is going on.
<string>Why don't we try talking to Maki?
<string>She often comes out here to gather oil.<lf>Maybe she saw something.
<string>Indeed. But whatever the cause, I think we can<lf>be certain this isn't a coincidence.
<string>Oh, wait. What if we go talk to that girl,<lf>Maki, was it?
<string>She may have noticed something while out<lf>on her gathering route.
<string>Huh? You want to know about the dead monsters<lf>in the Oilwell Basin?
<string>Right. Specifically the particularly dangerous<lf>ones. We call them "tempered."
<string>Well, sure. It's been a pretty hot topic.<lf>Roqul was just talking about it earlier.
<string>"Heard they took 'em all down with their bare fists!<lf>Talk about amazing!" Or something like that.
<string>No, we haven't— Wait, did you say bare fists?<lf>Against tempered monsters?
<string>Well, yeah. I actually just heard another story<lf>saying someone watched it happen.
<string>But thinking about it... That doesn't sound like<lf>the sort of thing you guys would do.
<string>Thanks, Maki. Though what you're describing still<lf>doesn't sound possible by human hands...
<string>Right? That's why I asked her where she saw it,<lf>so I could check.
<string>She said it was at the lowest part of the Subterrane.<lf>Hopefully they haven't left already...
<string>That's plenty to go on. Thanks a lot.<lf>We'll look into it from here.
<string>OK! Let me know if you have other questions.<lf>I'm always around. See ya!
<string>A non-hunter capable of this, here in the East...
<string>Who or whatever it is, we can't ignore the<lf>ecological impact. Let's track them down.
<string>A place where someone that punches monsters<lf>would go... Hmm, I can’t even begin to imagine.
<string>I’d probably want to rest somewhere safe.<lf>But that’s just me.
<string>How about starting at the bottom of the Subterrane?<lf>Oh! That reminds me. I’m not sure it’s related, but...
<string>Lately, folks have reported odd noises—like rocks being<lf>crushed. The Stonefolk say it's not them, so maybe...
<string>There. Do you suppose that's our man?
<string>Who are you?
<string>Greetings. We belong to an organization called the<lf>Hunter's Guild. To put it simply, we hunt monsters.
<string>Wait... That fighting spirit.<lf>I see you too are no stranger to death.
<string>And it's unbelievable what you can do with just your<lf>fists. You must've gone through rigorous training.
<string>That being said, you're doing a number on the<lf>ecology here. I'd like to ask you to stop.
<string>What cause have we to hesitate in dispatching<lf>these fell beasts? Are you not a hunter?
<string>Life does not hesitate to exterminate other life<lf>should it have reason to believe it is a threat.
<string>No matter how weak or how strong they are,<lf>all creatures can exhibit the desire to kill.
<string>I don't dispute that, sir, but the ideal we strive<lf>for is harmony with—
<string>Enough! Know this: All who seek true strength must<lf>walk this path! If you would quail before it, begone!
<string>I'm afraid we can't do that.
<string>Then show me! In turn, I offer you a glimpse<lf>of the abyss!
<string>Die one thousand deaths!
<string>Ugh...! Ngh...
<string>Each blow, a thousand. A thousand blows, as one.<lf>Master your craft and this shall be within your grasp.
<string>Nn...ngh...
<string>Has the weight of my fists sparked a killing intent<lf>within you, Hunter?
<string>The only path the powerless see before them<lf>is the one that keeps them powerless.
<string>Train endlessly. Push yourself to the brink in battle.<lf>Only then will the path to true strength open to you.
<string>Begone! If you would ask me to stay these fists,<lf>make me a show of your power!
<string>Speak to me then...and no sooner!
<string>Show me your strength!
<string>Couldn't muster the courage? You lack the training!
<string>Ummm... Am I imagining, or are...are you not<lf>quite yourself?
<string>True strength can only be obtained in a fight with your very<lf>life on the line. Now, to seek death and face it down!
<string>Such intensity! You almost sound like that Akuma<lf>fellow we met earlier.
<string>And...my eyes must be deceiving me,<lf>because you look just like him, too.
<string>Come, Alma. The battles to the death before me<lf>demand your witness!
<string>Uhhh... Sure? I mean, understood!<lf>I'm er...on it, I guess?
<string>Very well!
<string>I shall pierce the heavens and cause the Earth itself<lf>to scream! Sacrifice yourself to the Satsui no Hado!
<string>Attack, if you dare.
<string>Still not strong enough!
<string>Hm, you are a disgrace.
<string>Yes! This is the battle I hunger for!
<string>Heh, more!
<string>Weak...!
<string>A fist not prepared to take life, is a fist that<lf>cannot pierce the heavens.
<string>Is the deed done?
<string>Yes.
<string>The intent to kill lies at the core of martial arts. And<lf>martial arts without its core is a brittle thing. However...
<string>That killing intent has been by your creed—<lf>no, by your conviction sublimated...
<string>Though the paths you walk may differ...<lf>Your smile seems an echo of his.
<string>...Very well.
<string>Well then—!
<string>You have held fast to your creed, to the last.<lf>This farce of master and pupil has ended!
<string>Sir!
<string>Um, pupil...?
<string>A single strike must be trained a thousand, ten<lf>thousand times. That is the only way forward.
<string>May your journey be safe.
<string>To cease training is to invite weakness, Hunter.
<string>Thanks for your help out there! To think the decrease<lf>in tempered monsters was the work of human hands.
<string>I'm sorry, but I get this strange feeling that something<lf>is different about you. Like, you've gotten...stronger?
<string>Wait—what!? There really was someone out there<lf>fighting tempered monsters with their FISTS!?
<string>Huh. I guess you really can do anything<lf>if you put your mind to it...
