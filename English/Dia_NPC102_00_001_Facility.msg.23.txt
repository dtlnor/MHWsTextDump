<string>Hi, how are you?
<string>Want to see the quests?
<string>I'm here to help.
<string>We've received an assignment.
<string>This one calls for a cautious approach.
<string>I've got an important assignment for you.

<string>This quest here is addressed to you.
<string>Have you reviewed your item loadout?
<string>Did you double-check your equipment?
<string>Let's go do what we do best.
<string>Should I cancel our current quest?
<string>I can cancel a quest for you if you like.

<string>Shall we get started?
<string>Safety first, right?
<string>Not forgetting anything?

<string>Let's get to work, then.
<string>We'll take it one step at a time.
<string>I'm happy to help anytime.
<string>Understood.
<string>I'll be waiting here.
<string>Just let me know when you're ready.
<string>I see. Take your time.
<string>How are you today?
<string>Anything I can help with?
<string>Understood. Be careful out there.
<string>I thought this might catch your eye. We sophisticates<lf>know a piece of history when we— Right, the quests, sorry.
<string>Look at this sublime expression! It pulls at something<lf>deep inside the heart— OK, right. Quests first.
<string>This place is...exhilarating.
<string>I think a change of outfit might help me switch<lf>gears. Mind if I take a moment to do that?
