<string>Hi, how are you?
<string>Want to see the quests?
<string>I'm here to help.
<string>We've received an assignment.
<string>This one calls for a cautious approach.
<string>I've got an important assignment for you.
<string>A request came in you should look at.
<string>This quest here is addressed to you.
<string>Have you reviewed your item loadout?
<string>Did you double-check your equipment?
<string>Let's go do what we do best.
<string>Should I cancel our current quest?
<string>I can cancel a quest for you if you like.
<string>Once your Hunter Rank increases, the Guild<lf>will entrust you with more difficult quests.
<string>Shall we get started?
<string>Safety first, right?
<string>Not forgetting anything?
<string>We'll need to be cautious.
<string>Let's get to work, then.
<string>We'll take it one step at a time.
<string>I'm happy to help anytime.
<string>Understood.
<string>I'll be waiting here.
<string>Just let me know when you're ready.
<string>I see. Take your time.
<string>How are you today?
<string>Anything I can help with?
<string>Understood. Be careful out there.
<string>I thought this might catch your eye. We sophisticates<lf>know a piece of history when we— Right, the quests, sorry.
<string>Look at this sublime expression! It pulls at something<lf>deep inside the heart— OK, right. Quests first.
<string>Hey there. Need a hand with anything?
<string>The stack of investigation reports keeps getting<lf>taller by the day.
<string>Phew... Consistency is key.

<string>Care to join me?
<string>How's it going?
<string>(End Conversation)
<string>Oh, there's no need to worry about me. I have more<lf>than enough work here to keep me busy...
<string>I can't accompany you at the moment, but please be<lf>careful out there. I'll await your safe return here!
<string>Just leave it to me.
<string>Right, shall we get going?
<string>I'm excited to get out in the field.
<string>Please take care not to get hurt, Hunter.
<string>I'll be here, then.
<string>Be careful, now.
<string>This place is...exhilarating.
<string>I think a change of outfit might help me switch<lf>gears. Mind if I take a moment to do that?
<string>Oh, goodness! Look at all these decorations that<lf>strike right at the heart!
<string>I have to say, this has me feeling pretty festive!<lf>Should I maybe change my outfit to match?
<string>Now that is something!
<string>Well...far be it from me to swim against the tide...<lf>Shall I go and get changed, then?
