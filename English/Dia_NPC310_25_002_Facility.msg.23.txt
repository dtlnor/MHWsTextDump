<string>(End Conversation)
<string>Salutations, Hunter. Welcome to the Support Desk.
<string>We offer items supplied by the Guild, as well as<lf>important mews you won't want to miss.
<string>Hunter, listen! I've arranged for you to be able<lf>to pick up food shipments here at the Support Desk.
<string>It must be inconvenient, only having access to<lf>them at the Plains Base Camp.
<string>Whenever you're away from the desert, the Support<lf>Desk will handle all of your food shipments.
<string>Catch the latest mews here!
<string>I've got mews you won't want to miss!
<string>So long for now!
<string>Check back in every meow and again!
<string>Here's your share of the provisions, Hunter.<lf>I'll send anything your pouch can't hold to the item box.
<string>Take your share of these provisions, Hunter.
<string>Here, these provisions have been stacking up.<lf>Whatever your pouch can't hold, I'll send to the item box.
<string>I've bundled up some provisions for you.
<string>Sorry, no mew ingredients have come in yet...
