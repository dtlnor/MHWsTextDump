<string>Let's get ready.
<string>Breaks are a vital part of strategy.

<string>I mustn't forget to practice proper breathing<lf>techniques.
<string>These early mornings leave me a bit knackered.
<string>Right, then. Our target is that way.
<string>Keeping up with you certainly keeps me on my toes.
<string>Alright. Let's make for our target.

<string>I'm going on ahead! We'll meet up later.
<string>You can join me later.
<string>Looking to play, Hunter?

<string>Whoa.
<string>Phew...
<string>Now then...
<string>Alright.
<string>Over there? Understood.
<string>Right, let's get moving.
<string>Got it. Heading there now!

<string>Haha... Have you taken a liking to that hairstyle?
