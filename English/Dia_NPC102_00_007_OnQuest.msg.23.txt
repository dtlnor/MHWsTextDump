<string>Let's get ready.
<string>Breaks are a vital part of strategy.
<string>We shouldn't dally for too long, Hunter.

<string>I mustn't forget to practice proper breathing<lf>techniques.
<string>These early mornings leave me a bit knackered.
<string>Right, then. Our target is that way.
<string>Keeping up with you certainly keeps me on my toes.
<string>Alright. Let's make for our target.
<string>I'll go on ahead to our destination.
<string>I'm going on ahead! We'll meet up later.
<string>You can join me later.
<string>Looking to play, Hunter?

<string>Phew...
<string>Now then...
<string>Alright.
