<string>Where should we go first?
<string>We should prepare while we're in Base Camp.
<string>Well, look who it is. That was quite<lf>a show you put on back there.
<string>They told me you were good...but they failed<lf>to mention you were halfway outta your mind.
<string>I'm Olivia. We'll be working together<lf>a lot on this expedition.
<string>The pleasure's all mine.
<string>What else have you heard about me?
<string>What's your role here?
<string>(End Conversation)
<string>So, what else have you heard about me?<lf>I'm almost afraid to ask.
<string>People say you're a solitary bird.<lf>That you...prefer to work alone.
<string>So, why'd you agree to a cooperative<lf>undertaking like this? Change of heart?
<string>Mm. Change of something.
<string>Heh. Well, you're here now, and that's<lf>all that matters. I won't pry.
<string>How'd you get roped into this expedition?
<string>Oh, you don't know? My unit has a reputation<lf>for handling special assignments.
<string>I can already tell this is gonna be quite the ordeal,<lf>but...the rest of my unit is not too fussed.
<string>Sounds like they trust you.
<string>We have our objectives: the Keepers, the White<lf>Wraith...but there's more to the job than that.
<string>True hunters devote themselves to helping people.<lf>That's our calling.
<string>So wherever this journey takes us,<lf>let's answer that calling—together.
<string>Our paths are many, but the destination<lf>is always the same.
<string>So, have you been to the Training Area yet?
<string>There's no better place to learn the feel of a weapon.<lf>Have a look when you get the chance.
<string>This dream we walk through is fragile, and only through<lf>constant self-betterment do we delay its end.
<string>So they set up a Training Area, huh?<lf>Why don't we stop by?
<string>Welcome back, Hunter.<lf>Lookin' good out there!
<string>Thanks for looking after Nata and the other kid.<lf>Oh, and nice throw back there.
<string>Heh. What can I say? I come in handy.
<string>How's the Smithy coming along?
<string>That was a bumpy trip out there.
<string><COLOR FF0000>#Rejected#</COLOR> Dia_stCh01_Ms001040_0030_t005cc_
<string>Well, I got everything set up and ready to go!<lf>Whatcha think?
<string>It's not ideal, but I can make do.<lf>'Specially since we might be on the move soon.
<string>But don'tcha worry, I can still make anything<lf>you need to succeed out in the field!
<string>And if ya got materials, I can make ya somethin'.<lf>If you don't have enough, I got ya covered.
<string>Yeah, it was. Bumped you right off the ship<lf>and onto a Seikret! That took guts!
<string>And I've seen my fair share of guts—<lf>Wait, that came out wrong.
<string>My point is, seeing you jump off the boat<lf>brought back all kinds of memories.
<string>Good memories, I hope.
<string>Heh. Yeah. I used to go adventurin'<lf>with a hunter JUST like you.
<string>Together, we tore up the land, sea, and sky.<lf>It made me the adventurin' junkie I am today.

<string>Well, that's enough chitchat. See ya later<lf>at the big huddle, yeah?
<string>Well, if it ain't the Avis Unit! Here to stock up on provisions?<lf>Well, you came to the right place, but...
<string>We're still in the process of getting set up.
<string>The Support Team is a little behind schedule,<lf>so I can't really provide any provisions. Sorry!
<string>But they should be here anytime now. I'll get<lf>back to you after the meeting, deal?
<string>Hey there.
<string>Oh...hello.
<string>How are you holding up?
<string>Tell me about the day you were rescued.
<string>What kind of things do you like?
<string>(End Conversation)
<string>How are you holding up?
<string>I guess...I'm OK...
<string>I was so surprised when you jumped off<lf>the boat onto that bird thing...
<string>That was amazing.
<string>You think so?
<string>Yeah...
<string>Well, I hear you crossed the desert on foot.
<string>Yes. Outside the tunnel, it was sand in every direction.
<string>Tasheen—that's my father's friend—<lf>gave me some food and water.
<string>So I walked and walked...until I<lf>couldn't go another step.
<string>I don't remember anything after that.
<string>You were very brave.
<string>I guess so...
<string>So, uh, what kind of things do you like?
<string>Me? Uh, I don't really know...
<string>I liked the tea Alma made for us on the sandship.
<string>It was sweet...and smelled nice.
<string>Let's talk again later.
<string>OK.
<string>I think it's almost time for our meeting.
<string>Alright, is everyone here?
<string>Avis Unit, present.
<string>Astrum Unit, Rubrum Unit, Turris Unit,<lf>Ferrum Unit, present.
<string>Let's see... Provisions, Research...<lf>We're here—for the most part.
<string>Let's start with the good news: thanks to<lf>everyone, we're off to an excellent start.
<string>Indeed. We've already made human contact.
<string>The next thing to discuss is our short-term goals.
<string>We have two objectives: rescue the Keepers, and<lf>locate the White Wraith that attacked their village.
<string>Unfortunately, the tunnel Nata used has collapsed,<lf>and we don't know any other way to find his people.
<string>Any idea how long you were down there?
<string>I walked for several days. I'm not sure which way...<lf>After a while, it all started to look the same.
<string>Then we'll need to split up; make our<lf>search as wide as possible.
<string>Good deal, except I think it'd be better if you<lf>held off until the Support Team arrives.
<string>No objections here.
<string>This project to survey the Forbidden Lands has been<lf>in the works for years...and now here we are, finally.
<string>Thank you all. I'm sorry to<lf>cause so much trouble...
<string>It's all right, lad. We're in this together!
<string>First things first, I think we oughta escort Nona<lf>and Y'sai back to their village. For safety reasons.
<string>That seems wise. If we're lucky, someone there<lf>might have some information about the Keepers.

<string>Hey, can one of you help me out?<lf>My stockpile of honey is running low.
<string>Is it urgent? How bad do you need honey?
<string>And where the heck is the Support Team?
<string>I told them where to find us...
<string>Surely there's someone else that<lf>can take care of this?
<string>How's that wound looking?
<string>Does it still hurt?
<string>I'm fine now. We can leave when you're ready.
<string>I'm glad you're OK.
<string>Hey, over here.
<string>Are you ready to go?
<string>Yeah, let's head out.
<string>(Open the Quest Board)
<string>I need a little more time.
<string>Sure, take all you need. I can't wait to see<lf>Y'sai's village—although I am a bit nervous.
<string>We'll escort you back to your village.
<string>Thank you.
<string>Oh! Before I forget...
<string>Did you hear about Provisions' honey shortage?<lf>We should see if we can scrounge any up.
<string>If it's honey you're after, I know the perfect spot.<lf>I'll show you the way.
<string>That would be amazing!
<string>Well then, shall we?
<string>Don't wander too far off.
<string>You're lucky! Most people don't know<lf>about this spot I'm taking you to.
<string>I'll...stay here for now. Be careful, OK?
<string>Is your village far?
<string>A little...but on the Seikret, we'll be there in no time.
<string>They're fast all right.
<string>Yes, and handy if you need to make a quick<lf>getaway from a monster.
<string>They're clever, too, and good at picking up scents.<lf>I don't know what my people would do without them.
<string>I wanna become a Seikret rider too!
<string>I'm sure you'll be a great one, Nona!
<string>I see a lot of fulgurite... It's like<lf>the whole valley is made of it.

<string><COLOR FF0000>#Rejected#</COLOR> Dia_stCh01_Ms001040_0140_t003
<string>Fulgur...ite?<lf>Are you talking about gemchime stones?
<string>Gemchime stones? What a lovely name.<lf>Why do you call them that?
<string>Once we reach the village, you'll see.
<string>Wow, look at that!
<string>There's so many of them!
<string>Let's get closer.
<string>Tread carefully.
<string>Incredible... I've never heard of a<lf>Ceratonoth herd this big before.
<string>Some of them have big spikes on their backs!
<string>That's the male. Each herd consists of one male<lf>and a number of females.
<string>Here we've got Dalthydons.
<string>Wouldn't wanna butt heads with those things!
<string>Heh heh. Don't worry, they're not aggressive at all.
<string>Hold on. Those are Talioths over there.
<string>Yeah, we don't want to get too close to them.
<string>They're so scary!
<string>Alright, this is the spot.
<string>Great! Thank you.
<string>Is that a mountain? What a weird shape!
<string>You think so? We call it Wind's Gasp.
<string>It definitely takes my breath away.
<string>Over here.
<string>It smells so good!
<string>Be careful.
<string>Ack! Get away!
<string>Sorry about that.
<string>Did he call that mountain Wind's Gasp?
<string>I wonder what caused it to be that shape.
<string>I'd love to study it.
<string>That should be enough honey.
<string>On to the village, then?
<string>Yes, please follow me.
<string>Oh NO! I was supposed to draw water!<lf>I completely forgot!
<string>You're in for it now.
<string>Yeah, Zatoh's gonna give me an earful.
<string>Is there anything we can do to help?
<string>Please, no!
<string>If anything, it's me who owes YOU a favor.
<string>I'm starting to get nervous.
<string>To the villagers, we're outsiders.<lf>We don't want to do anything to offend them.
<string>It'll be fine. Just play it cool.
<string>Do you think they have Felynes like me there?
<string>Good question. The Guild hasn't seen evidence of<lf>any Lynians in the region...but you never know.
<string>I'll do my best not to startle them.
<string>We're here.
<string>Um...sorry we're late.
<string>Better late than dead. What happened?
<string>I had a run-in with a Giant Toad. Might've been<lf>its lunch if these people hadn't come along.
<string>Hello, sir. On behalf of the—
<string>You have rescued my friends. For that, I thank you.
<string>However, your visit is ill-timed.<lf>I must ask you to leave.
<string>But we owe them our hospitality! At least—

<string><COLOR FF0000>#Rejected#</COLOR> Dia_stCh01_Ms001040_0260_t009
<string>One more thing, which I am sure you understand:<lf>the Seikret are precious to our village...
<string>Of course. They'll be returned to you at once.
<string>Thanks for letting us use them.
<string><COLOR FF0000>#Rejected#</COLOR> Dia_stCh01_Ms001040_0260_t013
<string>We'll be going, then.
<string>Did you see that? The guards at the gates...
<string>They weren't carrying weapons.
<string>Y'sai didn't seem to know what weapons were either.
<string>Hey, wrong way!
<string>Just as Zatoh said, the timing is a bit bad.<lf>Apologies.
<string>Unusual clothes you're wearing.<lf>What village are you from?
<string>Huh?
<string>What the—?
<string>Bugs!
<string>These are Bulaqchi!
<string>Authorization?
<string>Granted! The Guild authorizes you<lf>to neutralize the threat!
<string>There's no end to them!
<string>Something's coming from over there!
<string>That was a fanged beast, right?
<string>Long gnashers, sharp claws? Yeah, I'd say so.
<string>Those villagers don't have weapons...
<string>This doesn't add up. They must have some<lf>means of keeping the monsters out.
<string>Maybe they've got some kinda thingamabobble.
<string>The world really is...massive, you know?
<string>It's so easy to forget that.
<string>Almost there.
<string>Stupid slow human legs.
<string>I miss the Seikret already...
<string>You should pay a visit to the Training Area.<lf>Staying in top form is a part of the job.
<string>True.
<string>I think this is our first proper chat. I'm Erik,<lf>with the Astrum Unit. Nice to meet you.
<string>You as well.
<string>I'm sure we're both eager to get started.<lf>Just what sort of creatures will we find here?
<string>We've slogged all the way out to the Forbidden<lf>Lands. Hope I find something here worth the trip.
<string>I'll bet you're thinking the same?
<string>...Athos. I expect we'll be seeing each other,<lf>Avis Unit Hunter.
<string>Nice meeting you.
<string>It was a real blessing that there<lf>were no serious injuries.
<string>Yes, absolutely. I resigned myself to<lf>a pretty grim fate back there.
<string>Y'sai, I... I was really scared.
<string>I'm so sorry. I thought it was the only option,<lf>but I was a fool...

<string>Hee hee... There's more here, too.
<string>Heaps and heaps of honey! Mm, it smells great.
