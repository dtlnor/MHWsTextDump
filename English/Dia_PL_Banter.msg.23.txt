<string>Let's try to keep a low profile.
<string>Agreed, let's be careful.
<string>Let's try to keep a low profile.
<string>I'd love to investigate, but better to err on<lf>the side of caution.
<string>Alright, where should we start?
<string>Let's check the map first.
<string>Now then, where to start...?
<string>Let's check the map first.
<string>Let's let the Seikret take us where we need to go.
<string>Right. I should mark our destination.
<string>It's easiest to let the Seikret handle<lf>the navigating.
<string>Right. I should mark our destination.
<string>Seikret have such gorgeous wings.
<string>Yeah.
<string>Seikret are so well-suited for this environment!
<string>Yeah.
<string>Let me sum up what we've learned.
<string>Sure, go ahead.
<string>Should I review our findings?
<string>Sure, go ahead.
<string>We should try to avoid any hazards as we investigate.
<string>It's all about being adaptable!
<string>Investigations call for a mix of prudence and daring.
<string>It's all about being adaptable!
<string>The Eastlands have such a strong scent.
<string>Do they? I guess you would know.
<string>The Eastlands have such a strong scent.
<string>Fascinating. Could it be due to the climate?
<string>My whiskers are pawfully sensitive.
<string>I can't help but want to touch them.<lf>But I'll refrain.
<string>My whiskers are pawfully sensitive.
<string>They're an invaluable part of Felyne anatomy.
<string>All creatures struggle to survive the wilds...
<string>Yes, they do...
<string>All creatures struggle to survive the wilds...
<string>And often it forces them to evolve in order to do so.
<string>A mew day means mew opportunities!
<string>And each step forward brings mew—er, new discoveries!
<string>A mew day means mew opportunities!
<string>Indeed! I'm so glad I came!
<string>When lightning strikes the sand, it creates fulgurite.
<string>And there's plenty of it here.
<string>Powerful lightning is required to form fulgurite.
<string>And there's plenty of it here.
<string>This region is called the Land of Blessed Winds.
<string>And it's vital to these people for their survival.
<string>The plains are so...alive!
<string>The sandstorm leaves this<lf>place better than it finds it.
<string>The land is emanating life!
<string>The sandstorm leaves this<lf>place better than it finds it.
<string>I think there are places in this forest that only<lf>Seikret can get to.
<string>It's worth investigating.
<string>With all this water, I bet you could<lf>even catch a whopper!
<string>It's worth investigating.
<string>Erik said this red water is safe to drink, but...
<string>You go first...
<string>So this is the effect of such a prolonged downpour!
<string>I wouldn't be surprised if the monsters<lf>and Wudwuds are affected too.
<string>Look how vibrant the vegetation is after all that rain!
<string>I wouldn't be surprised if the monsters<lf>and Wudwuds are affected too.
<string>I'm getting cooked here...
<string>That's just how it is here...
<string>The fauna here does well to survive in such<lf>an intense environment.
<string>That's just how it is here...
<string>The oil here seems to come from some<lf>ancient organic matter.
<string>And there must have been a lot<lf>of it to make this much.
<string>So this is what it looks like when it all burns up...
<string>It's like we're in another world.
<string>Will this landscape also change over time?
<string>It's like we're in another world.
<string>Ugh... It's freezing.
<string>We'll need to keep stocked up on hot drinks.
<string>I don't do well in cold environments.
<string>We'll need to keep stocked up on hot drinks.
<string>These structures must be pretty old.
<string>And there's so many of them...<lf>What were they all for?
<string>You can see the structures more clearly now<lf>that the snow is gone.
<string>Make sure to watch your step...
<string>Now that the blizzard has stopped, we should<lf>be able to find more creatures!
<string>Make sure to watch your step...
<string>Everything's bright white... It's kind of unsettling.
<string>I've never seen anything like this.
<string>Fascinating that creatures survive in such conditions!
<string>I've never seen anything like this.
<string>I can't imagine what this place looked like<lf>before it fell into ruin.
<string>Yeah, it's impressive in its own way.
<string>The things in the air appear<lf>to be leaves and cocoon fragments.
<string>Is it because of all the energy?
<string>The creatures here seem to be excited.
<string>Is it because of all the energy?
<string>Should we take a break?
<string>Good idea.
<string>I'm exhausted. Why don't we take a break?
<string>Good idea.
<string>I'll check our supplies.
<string>Yeah, thanks.
<string>If you want a report on our findings,<lf>just ask me.
<string>Yeah, thanks.
<string>Everyone seems like they're in good spirits.
<string>Let's prepare for the next hunt.
<string>We have no idea when a monster might appear.
<string>Let's stay on our toes.
<string>Can't forget supplies.
<string>I'm gonna take a catnap.
<string>Time to stock up.
<string>I'm gonna take a catnap.
<string>I'll put away the materials we found.
<string>I found a bunch, too!
<string>Better get the materials we found into storage.
<string>I found a bunch, too!
<string>Time for a quick break?
<string>Fur sure!
<string>I wonder how everyone's doing?
<string>Let's take a look around and see.
<string>Anything out of the ordinary?
<string>Let's take a look around and see.
<string>We may be able to get some<lf>information from the people here.
<string>We should ask around if we have time.
<string>Think anyone needs our help?
<string>We should ask around if we have time.
<string>Looks the same as always to me.
<string>That's good.
<string>Everyone looks so busy.
<string>We should try not to get in their way.
<string>Finally... We're here.
<string>Ahh, I love the smell of civilization!
<string>And here we are!
<string>Ahh, I love the smell of civilization!
<string>Should we have a look around?
<string>In we go!
<string>Wonder how everyone's doing?
<string>In we go!
<string>This place looks safe to me!
<string>Yeah, everyone seems well equipped<lf>to deal with the environment.
