<string>Let's try to keep a low profile.
<string>Agreed, let's be careful.
<string>Alright, where should we start?
<string>Let's check the map first.
<string>Let's let the Seikret take us where we need to go.
<string>Right. I should mark our destination.
<string>Seikret have such gorgeous wings.
<string>Yeah.
<string>Let me sum up what we've learned.
<string>Sure, go ahead.
<string>We should try to avoid any hazards as we investigate.
<string>It's all about being adaptable!
<string>The Eastlands have such a strong scent.
<string>Do they? I guess you would know.
<string>My whiskers are pawfully sensitive.
<string>I can't help but want to touch them.<lf>But I'll refrain.
<string>All creatures struggle to survive the wilds...
<string>Yes, they do...
<string>A mew day means mew opportunities!
<string>And each step forward brings mew—er, new discoveries!
<string>When lightning strikes the sand, it creates fulgurite.
<string>And there's plenty of it here.
<string>This region is called the Land of Blessed Winds.
<string>And it's vital to these people for their survival.
<string>The plains are so...alive!
<string>The sandstorm leaves this<lf>place better than it finds it.
<string>Should we take a break?
<string>Good idea.
<string>I'll check our supplies.
<string>Yeah, thanks.
<string>Everyone seems like they're in good spirits.
<string>Let's prepare for the next hunt.
<string>We have no idea when a monster might appear.
<string>Let's stay on our toes.
<string>Can't forget supplies.
<string>I'm gonna take a cat nap.
<string>I'll put away the materials we found.
<string>I found a bunch, too!
<string>Time for a quick break?
<string>Fur sure!
<string>I wonder how everyone's doing?
<string>Let's take a look around and see.
<string>We may be able to get some information from<lf>the people here.
<string>We should ask around if we have time.
<string>Looks the same as always to me.
<string>That's good.
<string>Everyone looks so busy.
<string>We should try not to get in their way.
<string>Finally... We're here.
<string>Ahh, I love the smell of civilization!
<string>Should we have a look around?
<string>In we go!
<string>This place looks safe to me!
<string>Yeah, everyone seems well equipped to deal with<lf>the environment.
