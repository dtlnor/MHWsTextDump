<string>We must strive to do our best,<lf>even in unknown territory.
<string>First, we should get the lay of the land.
<string>How is Nata coping? Still putting up a bold front?
<string>The Seikret are truly incredible creatures.<lf>They'll make good companions.
<string>Of all the missions to end up on...
<string>Once I have a future in mind, I pursue it.<lf>It's just how I am.
<string>It came out of nowhere as soon as the rain started—<lf>without even the slightest warning.
<string>The rain itself was just as sudden... This forest<lf>plays by strange rules.
<string>Stay extra vigilant out there. Erik will be a<lf>great help to you—I know it.
<string>It's you... Did something happen?
<string>It's you... Did something happen?
<string>We've finally reached the Keepers' village.<lf>...Nata is strong. He can handle what comes next.
<string>I know I can trust you to have my back.
<string>I think, one day, I'll look back at meeting the<lf>Allhearken as one of my life's greatest honors.
<string>That alone has made this journey worth it.
<string>While conducting special missions for the Guild,<lf>I have seen many things that defy common sense.
<string>It leaves me with plenty to chew on while we wait<lf>for our proverbial dawn.
<string>Who decides what sense is common in the first place?
<string>It never stops, huh? I'm not complaining. Better<lf>than being bored.
<string>What's wrong? If you're bored,<lf>join me for some training.
<string>I'm curious to see what your routine looks like.<lf>Come grab me sometime.
<string>Werner and Erik are both pros, eh? There's a bit<lf>of loose cannon in the mix there, too, I admit.
<string>On that front, Athos is the only one I know I<lf>don't need to worry about.
<string>Might as well get some paperwork cleared out while<lf>there's time.
<string>Can't say I'm thrilled about it, but Werner and<lf>Erik both have their hands full, so...
<string>You're the real deal, Hunter.
<string>Not sure I could have ever made the same call.
<string>These tempered monsters... We'll have to be<lf>sharper than ever out there.
<string>In times of bounty, we eat well. Well, the same<lf>holds true for monsters. It's simple logic.
<string>We'll focus on the Dragontorch here. Investigating<lf>the other regions is on you guys. Good luck.
<string>With this much energy moving around, the effects<lf>on other regions must be enormous.
<string>The regional investigations are in your hands. I'd<lf>love to help, but I can't leave the Dragontorch.
<string>At least I can promise you that we've got things<lf>here covered.
<string>Gore Magala's not a name I expected to hear out<lf>here. This place never ceases to surprise.
<string>I'm told Fabius has returned.
<string>I don't like the thought of making him wait. Let's<lf>get moving.
<string>Gore Magala... You don't need me to tell you what<lf>a threat it is.
<string>Just come back safe.
<string>You never disappoint... That's another crisis out<lf>here you've averted.
<string>Werner and Erik are both completely lost in their<lf>work. Glad they're having fun.
<string>They're always most productive in times like these.
<string>A lead on Arkveld, at last... Nata's hard work has<lf>paid off.
<string>The look on his face has really cleared up since<lf>the first time we met.
<string>This place will only continue to change. That's an<lf>unavoidable truth, I expect.
<string>But I at least intend to hold to my beliefs.
<string>A manmade creation run out of control may be more<lf>frightening than anything nature's wrought.
<string>All the more when the two combine.
<string>Like a bird, huh? There's an apt description if<lf>ever I heard one.
<string>It was every bit the behemoth of an investigation<lf>we thought going in, but... Heh, it had its moments.
<string>It helped me confirm what I hold inside me. That<lf>alone was worth it.
