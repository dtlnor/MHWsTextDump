<string>Able to keep going?
<string>Can you persevere?
<string>Time to grit those teeth!
<string>Your fight's only just begun!
<string>Put it out of your head and start fresh.
<string>Don't get greedy. Eyes peeled!
<string>Incoming! Look alive!
<string>Apologies...!
<string>My thanks.
<string>The day has yet to be won! Stay focused!
<string>Now!
<string>It's trapped!
<string>Here it comes. On your guard!
<string>No... Get clear of it!
<string>We rush it down!
<string>We won't miss this chance!
<string>Keep your distance. No need to get involved.
<string>Alright, I'm on it!
<string>Let's take our time here.
<string>Don't let it escape!
<string>Mission complete. Well done, Hunter.
<string>Fine work, and an impeccable result.
<string>That was...rather close.
<string>Sorry to keep you.
<string>We'll move together.
<string>Allow me to join you?
<string>Target sighted.
<string>Visual on the target.
<string>Keep your mind sharp...
<string>I will assist where I am able.
<string>Commencing mission.
<string>Stay flexible and adapt.
<string>It'll take more than...
<string>Apologies. Go on without me.
<string>I'll rejoin you soon!
<string>Sorry to have kept you waiting!
<string>Rendezvous complete.
<string>Explosives placed.
<string>Explosives, armed and ready.
<string>Trap placed.
<string>Trap, primed and ready.
<string>Back on your feet?
<string>That was a close call.
<string>How's this?
<string>A little goes a long way.
<string>Flash incoming!
<string>Blinding the target!
<string>Deploying sonic bomb!
<string>This sound will set it reeling!
<string>Firing dung pod!
<string>Redirecting the target with a dung pod!
<string>No, hold yourself together!
<string>I owe you a debt.
<string>Look alive. We're not done yet!
<string>I won't let you escape!
<string>After it. Time to focus.
<string>Pursuing target!
<string>Mission complete. Excellent work.
<string>Everyone safe, it seems? Good.
<string>Nothing but clear skies ahead.
<string>That was quite impressive, Hunter.
<string>Your work is a fine example for the others.
<string>You really are something else.
<string>No injuries, I hope?
<string>Right, I'm falling back.
<string>Withdrawing for now. I leave it to you.
<string>This is a sizable one. Don't let it intimidate you.
<string>What an impressive physique. It must<lf>get plenty of nutrients.
<string>It may be diminutive, but that doesn't mean<lf>we can let our guard down.
<string>I've never seen one so extraordinarily small.
<string>I'm glad to be of assistance.
<string>I've placed a trap and am lying in wait!
<string>I'm lying in wait!
<string>You're made of sterner stuff than this.
<string>Conduct evasive maneuvers! It's going to attack!
<string>We cannot afford to lose you!
<string>You have my thanks.
<string>It's beginning its death throes...
<string>The time has come to launch our attack!
<string>Be vigilant! It's about to attack!
<string>Attack it with everything you have!
<string>Use every technique you know!
<string>They're squabbling. We can use this to our advantage.
<string>Fine work. You have impeccable aim.
<string>Part broken. Marvelous work.
<string>Raaaaaah!
<string>Don't worry about me! I'll persevere!
<string>Allow me to step up!
<string>I cannot fail now!
<string>This is what the weapons we carry are for.
<string>You must live...and keep on living!
<string>Do you not require rest? Haha...
<string>That's one down.
<string>I have much I can learn from you.
<string>I could stand to learn a thing<lf>or two from you.
