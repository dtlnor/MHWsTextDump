<string>Ah, it's you. Sorry things are a bit chaotic here.
<string>Did something happen?
<string>One of the kids got hurt. Ran into a...what did<lf>you people call them? Rompopolo?
<string>Not sure if their numbers are up or what, but you<lf>see the things all over, lately.
<string>I see... If you're aware and avoiding them, and<lf>people are still getting hurt, we may need to act.
<string>Maybe... I guess if even the Bonefolk are having<lf>issues, the Oilfolk must have it even worse.
<string>Right. And if they have begun to multiply, there<lf>could be other effects on the ecosystem here.
<string>Humans' coexistence with monsters is built on top<lf>of a more fragile balance than we like to think.
<string>Huh. I'll take your word on that. ...I guess even<lf>in our work, a little slip leads to big problems.
<string>Alright, then. I'll leave it to you. Just be<lf>careful out there, yeah?
<string>The Rompopolo were multiplying unchecked. We were<lf>able to contain the damage, thanks to your report.
<string>Their reproduction rates must have spiked for<lf>some reason, beyond what the system could sustain.
<string>This doesn't make them any less dangerous to<lf>approach, though. Please stay cautious out there.
<string>Thank you. I'll be sure to tell the others.
<string>I appreciate you doing this for us. Made for a<lf>good lesson, too.
<string>If something about the monsters changes, we need<lf>to change on our end, too.
<string>Same as changing materials means you need to<lf>change the way you work them.
<string>...Oh, right. Everyone is incredibly grateful. They<lf>want to help you out as thanks. Humor them.
<string>I'm sure I'll have cause to take them up on that.
<string>A preliminary investigation has confirmed Aida's<lf>report. The Rompopolo population has exploded.
<string>Normally, that increase would be met with a<lf>proportional rise in predator species...
<string>But it seems like that hasn't been the case here.<lf>The local ecosystem may already be destabilizing.
<string>Agreed. The situation requires some intervention,<lf>before life here becomes unsustainable.
<string>When you're ready, let's set out to winnow that<lf>Rompopolo population and secure the area.
