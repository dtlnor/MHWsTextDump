<string>Please, come in.
<string>This is my family.
<string>Welcome.
<string>...Welcome.
<string>Nice to meet you. We're travelers from the Westlands.
<string>Please, take a seat.
<string>Thank you again for inviting us.<lf>You're very kind.
<string>I'm the one who should be thankful.
<string>A home-cooked meal is the least we can do for you.
<string>It looks lovely... I'm lost for words!
<string>May the winds bring blessed bounty
<string>to all that walk this land.
<string>Now, please, eat your fill.
<string>Thank you. Shall we, then?
<string>Oh...
<string>What a great aroma. It's wheat-based?
<string>That's right. It goes great with beans.
<string>How about some music?
<string>Thank you for the lovely meal,
<string>and for taking the time to welcome us.
