<string>I'm ready whenever you are.
<string>You and I can go anywhere if we try.
<string>Do I have everything? Pen, phials, journal,<lf>magnifying glass, what else...?
<string>This jacket's been through quite a lot with me.
<string>Don't straw hats make you want to go<lf>somewhere sunny?
<string>Now I can experience nature's elements unhindered.
<string>Alright, let's fill this bug cage to bursting!
<string>I just got a craving to join Azuz's<lf>Firespring Festival.
<string>Oh, this one is cool. Look, I have goosebumps!
<string>What species do you suppose they modeled these<lf>ears and tail after?
<string>I have the strangest feeling I could go without<lf>a wink of sleep and be fine.
<string>Ever wish you had been born as something other<lf>than human? Heh, or is that just me?
