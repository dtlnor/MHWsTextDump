<string>I'm so glad to speak with you again, Hunter. Will<lf>you hear one final request from me?
<string>Need more endemic life to study?
<string>I do, but this time I require a species<lf>found in the Ruins of Wyveria.
<string>As you surely know, it is a place rife with peril.<lf>Please be extremely cautious.
<string>I saw the latest report from the ecological survey<lf>of the Ruins of Wyveria.
<string>It's progressed by leaps and bounds, thanks to<lf>your help, Hunter. ...And, a confession—
<string>While I may have been competing with Samin at<lf>first, I've really come to enjoy our collaborations.
<string>It's been worthwhile for me as well.
<string>Well, allow me to thank you, on behalf of the<lf>entire ecological survey. Truly.
<string>Pillopods and their variants, Gillopods, are alike in<lf>subsisting on a diet of pure energy.
<string>But the Gillopod is thought only to live in areas<lf>of exceptionally high energy concentration.
<string>Apparently they'll stick to walls in odd shapes.<lf>I'd love to see it myself one day.
