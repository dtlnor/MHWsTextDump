<string>Onward, to the great above.

<string>What a terrible place to get lost.<lf>And with no fur to keep you warm.
<string>It is quite frigid. I'd say it's as intense<lf>as the Sandtide and the Downpour.
<string>Does it ever get, y'know, a little warmer?
<string>Nay, it has been raging for years. Never ceasing,<lf>never abating—nary a lull.
<string>A never-ending winter!?<lf>Great.
<string>Add that to our list of wonky phenomena right below<lf>"premature Sandtide" and "no-show Firespring."
<string>Do you think...this is the cliff Satesh<lf>talked about?
<string>Yes...or at least what he thinks is a cliff.
<string>Nata, does this look familiar at all?
<string>Rove, what can you tell me about this place?
<string>No, I've never seen it.
<string>But...I don't know how to explain this...<lf>Something about it feels like my village.
<string>My esteemed garden. A delightful mix<lf>of hollowness and bleakness.
<string>Something about it tickles at an old memory<lf>from across the vagaries of time.

<string>Everything OK?
<string>I've been meaning to ask you something.
<string>Fabius said it was you who put my name forward<lf>for the expedition. Why'd you pick me?
<string>I guess...I wanted someone who understood<lf>what it was like to lose something important.
<string>There was a time when I closed myself off<lf>from the world. But then I met Nata.
<string>Despite having lost everything he knew,<lf>he was still captivated by the world.
<string>Seeing that inspired me... It made me realize<lf>I should also be out living life.
<string>The Professor wanted a hunter we could trust<lf>Nata with, and with your background...
<string>I had a good feeling that you were the one.
<string>I hope I can live up to your expectations.
<string>You already have! When I first saw you leap onto<lf>that Seikret, my heart nearly burst from my chest.
<string>I felt so...alive! I knew I made<lf>the right choice.
<string>Alright, let's take a rest.<lf>I'm sure the road ahead is long...
<string><COLOR FF0000>#Rejected#</COLOR> Dia_stCh0209_Ms003240_0050_t002
<string>I'd forgotten how good it feels to move forward.
<string>Oh, hello...
<string>Rove is far from home just like me...<lf>I wonder if I'll ever see my village again.
<string>You will.
<string>Um...I'm really sorry for how I acted before.
<string>It's OK. We're just worried about ya.
<string>I feel so stupid.
<string>I thought finding my village would be easy.<lf>That I could take you straight there.
<string>I had no idea just how big the world is.
<string>I can't believe I can't even show you the way.<lf>I feel so useless...
<string>Nata. In a thousand years, there's only been one<lf>person resilient enough to make the trek west. You.
<string>Despite being alone, you found help.<lf>For the sake of your people.
<string>We'll set out again once the Hirabami retreat,<lf>but for now, let's get some rest, OK?
<string>Hunter, ever since meeting you, I...
<string><COLOR FF0000>#Rejected#</COLOR> Dia_stCh0209_Ms003240_0080_t002
<string>...
<string>You get some rest?
<string>Hey, Hunter... Let's say there's this little girl.
<string>And she feels like she has to solve all the problems<lf>alone. If you met this girl, what would you say?
<string>And you're worried about this girl?
<string>Yeah... I used to be a lot like her.
<string>A long time ago, I left home, and the people<lf>who took me in— They seemed larger than life.
<string>Then I grew up and realized that actually,<lf>adults can be just as lost as kids.
<string>When I left my village, they clapped me<lf>on the back and said, "Fly far, lil'un."
<string>But now...I think they were really saying:<lf>"It's your turn now. What do you choose to protect?"
<string>I've got something I want to mull over.<lf>You rest up, Hunter.

<string>Those nostalgic days feel so close,<lf>but they really aren't.
<string>Is it your fate to press ever onward?<lf>It seems our roads diverge somewhat.
<string>Yours seems a path blinding in its brilliance.<lf>But I hold my wandering ways with pride, as well.
<string>The world is vast.

<string>My Wudwud nature feels it clear—detours are among<lf>people's finest prerogatives.
<string>Losing one's way can be a wonderful thing.
<string>I had no idea this place was so huge...
<string>It's so different up close, compared to<lf>seeing it from a distance.
<string>You think it'll look even more different after<lf>we're finished with this mission?
<string>I'm glad I got to come here with you.
<string><COLOR FF0000>#Rejected#</COLOR> Dia_stCh0209_Ms003240_0130_t005
<string>I hope Nata's OK.
<string>It's not safe to go until the Hirabami retreat.
<string>Have a seat. Rest.
<string>OK. I think I'm starting to figure out the connection<lf>between Wylk and the Landspine.
<string>I think the Landspine is an artificial structure, like<lf>this one, probably built by an ancient civilization.
<string>Yes, I agree. They share too many architectural<lf>similarities to ignore.
<string>Then we know three things: First, Wylkstone<lf>is produced by the Landspine.
<string>Second, the Landspine isn't natural.
<string>And third, the Landspine is likely connected<lf>to phenomena like the Sandtide and the Downpour.
<string>Add it all up, Wylk seems to be an artificial energy<lf>source capable of altering the weather.
<string>Isn't Werner in the process of repairing the part<lf>of the Landspine connected to Azuz?
<string>Yeah...and if he succeeds, there's no telling<lf>what'll happen.
<string>We better be quick, then.
<string>Everything's all right. Let's calm down. I'll get our packs<lf>together so we can head back straight away.
<string>...Good. Now, need to swap out any gear before<lf>dealing with those Hirabami?
<string>It must be tough, being furless...
<string>Father...
<string>Hang in there, Nata...
<string>Hirabami sighted. Hunting one should put<lf>the others in line.

<string>Hirabami spit an icy secretion to hinder their prey's<lf>movement. Don't get caught in it!
<string>Area secure. It's safe to bring Nata out.
<string>Azuz sounds like it's in trouble too.<lf>Fur's givin' me a bad feelin'...
<string>All the more reason to hurry.
<string>Rove, we owe you one. Thanks.
<string>Forget me. Go. If fate wills it,<lf>we shall meet again.
<string>We'll have to keep an eye on him,<lf>but Nata seems to be resting better now.
<string>That's a relief. Let's go talk to<lf>Werner while he sleeps.
