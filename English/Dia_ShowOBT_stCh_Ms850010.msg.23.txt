<string>Hey there, Hunter.
<string>We've confirmed sightings of Doshaguma, fierce<lf>monsters with a nasty temperament, here in the plains.
<string>As it's likely that they're traveling in a pack, we've been<lf>authorized to deal with the threat before it gets out of control.
<string>I've marked the target on your map.<lf>For now, let's make for that location.
<string>Got it.
<string>Take these too while you're at it.<lf>I'm sure you'll find them useful.
<string>Have you selected your weapons?<lf>If not, you can do so in the tent over there.
<string>Right now I'm carrying a great sword and a light bowgun.
<string>You can equip both a primary and secondary weapon.<lf>Use this to your advantage, depending on the situation.
<string>That alpha is our target! The quest will begin<lf>once you've dealt enough damage to it.
<string>Got it!
<string>They're too dangerous as a pack.<lf>We need to separate them.
<string>Using Large Dung Pods could force<lf>the pack to disperse!
<string>There are other monsters here...
<string>Have you selected your weapons?<lf>If not, you can do so in the tent over there.
<string>You can equip both a primary and secondary weapon.<lf>Use this to your advantage, depending on the situation.
<string>Are you OK? That Alpha sure packs a punch...
