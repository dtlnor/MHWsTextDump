<string>I heard the news, Hunter. You pitched in with the<lf>survey of the Scarlet Forest.
<string>Yes, at the request of a researcher named Samin.
<string>I see... Stealing my idea, and my hunter—
<string>Ah, forgive me. An unrelated thought.
<string>Though, now that it's come to this, I'll be<lf>requiring additional assistance from you.
<string>The endemic life in question this time lives in<lf>the Oilwell Basin. I trust you'll capture it swiftly.
<string>Splendid work once again, Hunter. This concludes<lf>my work here. ...Bet he can't say the same.
<string>I cannot express my gratitude for your help.
<string>I hope that the two of us, specifically, can<lf>continue to enjoy a fruitful partnership.
<string>Ember Rufflizards are said to be exceptionally well<lf>suited to life in hot climates.
<string>They favor the toastiest corners of the Oilwell<lf>Basin. If you see lava, you're on the right track.
