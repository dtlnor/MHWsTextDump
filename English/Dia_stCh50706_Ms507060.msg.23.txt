<string>You've got good timing. I just finished something.
<string>Wyvern Milk's a bit tricky to handle, but fusing it with<lf>some local materials got some promising results.
<string>Wyvern Milk...? What did you make?
<string>Probably faster to just have a look for yourself.
<string>Join me for a test run of the prototype.<lf>I set up a quest. You can put it through its paces.
<string>Alright. I'll have a look once I've prepared.
<string>Nice. I'd call that experiment a success.<lf>Appreciate you clearing me to join you in the field.
<string>I'm the one who's grateful. Did you use Wyvern<lf>Milk to amplify the force behind the blast trigger?
<string>It felt like the force of the explosion itself was<lf>amplified, too.
<string>Hey, not bad! You're right on the zenny. I was<lf>trying for a sympathetic reaction between the two.
<string>As you saw, it was plenty effective on Guardians.<lf>Seems like there are scads of uses for this stuff.
<string>Infusing the core might give an even bigger<lf>efficiency boost. Problem's stability, though...
<string>It seems plenty effective, even as it is now.
<string>Ahh, you still don't see it. The potential this<lf>Wyvern Milk's still hiding.
<string>Well, whatever. More fun for me. I'll call you<lf>when I've got something new. See ya.
