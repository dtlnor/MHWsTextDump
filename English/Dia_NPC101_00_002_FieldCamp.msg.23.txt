<string>That might be a suitable place to set up camp.
<string>Quatreflies! Any area they inhabit is guaranteed<lf>to be safe.
<string>Do you think that might be a good place<lf>to set up camp? We should go have a look.
<string>It might be dangerous to set up camp here.
<string>Are we going to set up camp here? If so then<lf>now's a good time to free up some bag space.
<string>Yes, this seems to be a small distance from<lf>any monster habitats. Shall we set up camp?
<string>We could probably set up camp here.
<string>If you're looking to set up camp,<lf>I'd recommend this location.
<string>There are plenty of Quatreflies here. That means<lf>it should be safe to set up camp.
<string>Very nice. I doubt we could find any place<lf>better suited to set up camp.
<string>This place is absolutely marvelous! We should<lf>set up camp here.
<string>This takes me back! Olivia used one all the time.
<string>Amazing! I can't pry my eyes away<lf>from your expertise!
<string>Meat roasted on one of those practically compels<lf>you to take a huge bite out of it.
<string>Oh dear. Understandable, when it handles<lf>differently than you're used to.
<string>I guess this setup requires some getting used to?<lf>I'm sure you'll nail the next attempt!
<string>What little visitors do you suppose<lf>we'll have here?
<string>Thank you! If some endemic life moves in here,<lf>I'll be able to observe them up close!
<string>Look, we have an Amstrigian visitor.
<string>Amstrigian limbs bear bumps similar to feather<lf>follicles. It makes them excellent tree-climbers.
<string>They can even stay perfectly still in gale force<lf>winds. Though they aren't the strongest flyers.
<string>Even so, they flap with all their might for their<lf>young. The instinctual tenacity of life is amazing.
<string>Chicks bear tear-shaped markings around their<lf>eyes, but whether they serve a purpose is unknown.
<string>You're right, that's fascinating stuff.
<string>That's a fine Dapperwing specimen.
<string>They're fascinating. Among hatchlings, the ratio<lf>of males to females is nearly one-to-one.
<string>But males are notably more prevalent among<lf>the adult population.
<string>There are many theories, such as simple differences<lf>in survival rate. But we're still not certain.
<string>When even familiar species have unsolved mysteries,<lf>it's no surprise that I struggle to crack it myself!
<string>Yeah, you may be right about that.
<string>We have an Ember Rufflizard visiting.
<string>Rufflizards' defining trait is the pronounced lamella<lf>that protrudes from the corners of their mouths.
<string>A closer look reveals that the membrane is split<lf>down the middle into a top and bottom portion...
<string>Normally, they keep both portions perfectly<lf>overlapped, one tucked away behind the other.
<string>Imagine if humans had a similar tissue structure<lf>or body! Augh, it's all just so fascinating.
<string>Hmm... Yeah, I never thought of that.
<string>Oh, look. It's a Downy Crake.
<string>Did you know? If you look closely at a Downy<lf>Crake's back, you'll see a subtle pattern.
<string>And don't the specimens here in the Eastlands feel<lf>a bit...tougher? Than those back west?
<string>The Downy Crakes back home ride around on the<lf>backs of slow-moving herbivores.
<string>But out here, they hitch rides on rough-moving<lf>animals like Rafma without being shaken off.
<string>Now that you mention it, that's true.
<string>Look, I spy a Gawkie!
<string>Were you aware? A Gawkie's teeth continue<lf>to grow their entire lives.
<string>But excessive growth becomes a hindrance,<lf>so they maintain the length themselves.
<string>That's why you'll see them chomping on rocks and<lf>other hard objects—to wear down their incisors.
<string>Oh! Do you suppose the Wylk pools in this area are<lf>the result of Gawkie dental care?
<string>Good point. That's a definite possibility.
<string>We speak of insects as if they're one entity,<lf>but their variety and ecology are myriad.
<string>That diversity has offered us humans a tremendous<lf>number of important discoveries over the years...
<string>I'm glad that recent research allows us to make<lf>extractions while leaving the creature unharmed.
<string>Also, it's interesting to note that Thunderbugs<lf>here look slightly different from those back west.
<string>Adapting to one's environment is necessary to<lf>survival. How far can evolution take us, I wonder.
<string>They're making new discoveries every day, huh?
<string>Are you interested in endemic life as well?<lf>Amazing! Let's observe together awhile.
<string>Curious? Oh, I understand.<lf>Let's have a look together.
<string>Ahaha. I'd say you made a friend.
<string>Wow, their kind rarely grow<lf>so friendly with humans.
<string>Thank you, that was really fun.
<string>Alright, I should probably return to work.<lf>But let's do this again soon, OK?
<string>Ah... Oh. I guess that's goodbye.<lf>I suppose we should get going, too.
<string>The air... Smells like the weather is changing.<lf>Let's chat again later.
<string>Uh-oh, we have a monster. We'll pick up<lf>this chat another time.
<string>Alright, we can chat again soon.
<string>Wow, this is quite the impressive set.<lf>I imagine Alma would love it.
<string>A cup of tea is nice, every now and again.
<string>Actually, I'll just wait for Alma. Anytime I make<lf>tea it just tastes like leaf soup.
<string>Do you like tea, Erik?
<string>Alma's tea selection is lovely, but I'm also<lf>partial to mushroom or bean varieties.
<string>Amazing! Our own cultivation starts today!
<string>I can't wait to see what specimens grow for us.
<string>The mushrooms are growing well! We should<lf>keep a close eye on them.
<string>The mushrooms are... Oh, wonderful!<lf>They look perfect for harvest, I'd say.
<string>Hmm? One doesn't see a mushroom like this very<lf>often. You've grown something quite special.
<string>Uh-oh... We missed the harvest for the mushrooms.<lf>We'll have to pay closer attention next time.
<string>It seems we're a bit past peak harvest. Some<lf>mushrooms seem salvageable, at least.
