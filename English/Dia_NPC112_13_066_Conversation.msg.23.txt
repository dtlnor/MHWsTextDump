<string>Welcome, traveler. Stay and watch as long<lf>as you like.
<string>Right, time to put in another day of good work!
<string>I love my work! Which I'm sure is obvious.
<string>Imagine doing something you don't like, day after<lf>day. I'm not crazy enough to live that way.
<string>I worked hard like I always do. That's why<lf>there's not a speck of doubt in my mind.
<string>Whatever happens, I got no regrets.<lf>I know I did all I could.
<string>If I did my best but the Oricalcite doesn't shine...<lf>Well, I guess that's what happens sometimes.
<string>...Not that I'm worried, mind you!
<string>Hey, you guys done the rounds with the other<lf>tribes yet?
<string>Those guys say anything about how it's looking<lf>this time around?
<string>Just... Y'know, I'm a little curious.
<string>Haven't seen you around these parts before.<lf>You a traveler?
<string>Us Bonefolk under Aida are the most technically<lf>accomplished artisans in Azuz, no contest.
<string>I'm sure the other tribes are doing their best,<lf>but it's just no competition.
<string>We get this far, and the festival's not starting?<lf>This has never happened before.
<string>This is just stupid. Why did we bust our rears all<lf>this time for no payoff?
<string>Hey, what's the cause anyway?
<string>And now monsters! Just what do these things think<lf>this village is!?
<string>...I'll be real, I always thought the Oilfolk were<lf>even more of a lost cause than the Stone.
<string>But that young gal? She's got potential.
<string>Lately, Aida's has us going around talking<lf>to folks from the other tribes for a change.
<string>The idea's to share info so we can all be better<lf>prepared for a freak incident like before.
<string>Uhh... I'm still not seeing a Firespring here?<lf>Ugggh, this sucks. I give up.
<string>The Firespring finally hits and now I hear it's<lf>gone berserk? We can't have anything nice!
<string>Firespring still showing no signs of ending?<lf>I'm reaching my limit here!
<string>And now the Black Flame... Why's it gotta come and<lf>ruin our festival!?
<string>...Guess you saved our butts again.
<string>Ugh... Whole thing makes me feel a bit useless.<lf>You guys are wild, though.
<string>It's been one surprise after another here. Really<lf>shows the importance of keeping a level head.
<string>Easier said than done, though.
<string>You've been pulling our rears out the fire all this<lf>time, but we wanna do what we can for you, too.
<string>Whether it's work, emergency<lf>prep or whatever else...
<string>If you don't do all you can while you can,<lf>you'll only regret it later.
