<string>So the oil fields are just beyond here?
<string>Yes, along our trade route. I can vouch<lf>for its safety.
<string>How long have you been trading?
<string>How does trading work?
<string>We got some information from the Wudwuds.
<string>Have you been trading with this village long?
<string>Since beyond remembering. After the season<lf>of plenty we travel there to trade.
<string>Of course, traveling during the season<lf>of Fallow has its risks.
<string>I was passed this responsibility some time ago,<lf>and our way of life continues unchanged.
<string>What sort of products do you trade?
<string>We offer leather, dairy products, and gemchime crafts.<lf>In return, they provide metalwork and refined oil.
<string>It's also a chance for us to acquire<lf>unique materials only produced there.
<string>Mm! Like the sound of that.
<string>Oh, right. Did you learn anything<lf>from the Wudwuds?
<string>They didn't see the White Wraith...<lf>and its trail has gone cold.
<string>Shame. We may learn something<lf>in this village, though.
<string>Might be a chance to ask after the Keepers, too.
<string>These Seikret are spectacular. Nothing like that<lf>wagon in Val Habar. Remember that?
<string>Ah, that thing. Can still feel its turns in my bones.
<string>The motion sickness lasted for days.
<string>It was a damn beautiful mess.
<string>Oh, is this it?
<string>The people call it the Oilwell Basin.
<string>As the name suggests, oil wells up here during one<lf>season and then burns in a raging fire the next.
<string>Fire is the way of the land, then.
<string>We should consider investing in some<lf>heat-resistant equipment.
<string>Can't argue with that.
<string>Don't look down.
<string>Don't fall from your perch, now.
<string>It's fine, the Seikret can glide to catch us.
<string>Tight squeeze...
<string>This paired with the bridge must be effective at<lf>keeping large monsters out.
<string>We are nearly to the Everforge, Azuz.
<string>I'm getting excited.
<string>An artisan's paradise!
<string>You said there were three tribes? I wonder how<lf>the Bonefolk source their materials!
<string>I wonder if any of it's worth a sniff.
<string>Both of you, try not to embarrass us.
<string>I will introduce you to the chiefs when we arrive.<lf>Do not fret about formalities, they are quite casual.
<string>That would be great, thank you.
<string>Alma, can we ask about the Keepers?
<string>Of course we will.
<string>I should meet the Oilfolk's chief before I go.
<string>I need to ask the Oilfolk chief about the Keepers.
<string>So, Alma and the others are going to<lf>talk to the chief. What's your plan?
<string>The Oilfolk's chief is a man by the name Yabran.
<string>He was once renowned for his strength<lf>and fearlessness...
<string>Well...he must be quite a person.
<string>Though churlish, his heart is in the right place.
<string>I am certain he will help you.
<string>I'm eager to speak with him.
<string>We should go properly greet the leader of the Oilfolk.<lf>We may be working alongside him for some time.
<string>I agree.
<string>I hope we can learn something of the Keepers.
<string>The Oilfolk chief is this way. If you please.
<string>That girl who ran off—do you know her?
<string>That is Maki. She is Yabran's apprentice.
<string>Her tribe's standing in the village<lf>weighs heavy upon her.
<string>Though she is blind to Yabran's worry.
<string>She looked like she was<lf>carrying some sort of jar.
<string>Let us pray she returns soon.
<string>Yes, we are "hunters." We use these<lf>weapons to take on monsters.
<string>We are on an expedition in search<lf>of a particular monster.
<string>I see, so you came all this way from the West.
<string>This clime is rather sweltering... I fear this is<lf>a place inhospitable to those of us with a long coat.
<string>Might it not be wise to switch to gear well-suited<lf>to the heat as Livvie suggested?
<string>I sadly lack that option. Whatever I wear atop it,<lf>I won't escape the heat as long as I have this fur...
<string>This village's inhabitants all appear to be<lf>obsessed with something called "Oricalcite."
<string>A metal possessed of a bewitching sheen, they say.
<string>Heh... Myself, I can't help but think the ones<lf>bringing about that sparkle are the brighter lights.
<string>This heat is bringing back a sense memory...<lf>What do you think of the flavor of cool drinks?
<string>I tried one in the past, but it was absolutely<lf>impossible to focus with that taste in my mouth.
<string>Oooh... Wowww...
<string>It moooves!
<string>It's aliiive!
<string>Don't be scared. Let's play!
<string>These kids say I'm the first<lf>Felyne they've ever met.
<string>They're losing their minds over how soft my fur<lf>is. ...Heheh.
<string>S-So...fluffy! SO FLUFFY!
<string>It's a cloud! How's it so fluffy!?<lf>It's a <ITALIC>talking cloud!</ITALIC>
<string>Never seen these monster materials before...
<string>Everyone is excited for the festival. We're gonna<lf>craft some true wonders this season!
<string>Looks like you're all unpacked, visitor. Good.<lf>Stay and enjoy the festival.
<string>What all do you do for the festival?
<string>Well, I'm glad you asked. The Firespring Festival<lf>is a tradition that goes back forever.
<string>When the Firespring comes to the Oilwell Basin,<lf>each of the tribes procures their own materials,
<string>and we use the event's unbelievable heat to craft<lf>Oricalcite in the Everforge, heart of our Azuz.
<string>It's what we <ITALIC>live</ITALIC> for! ...Plenty of folks here<lf>will tell you that, I'm sure.
<string>Truth is, the last few Oricalcite batches have<lf>been duds. It's been an age since we saw that shine.
<string>Any guesses what's been going wrong?
<string>To be perfectly blunt, it's the oil. The Oilfolk<lf>have come up short, or brought impure stuff.
<string>It takes all three pieces to make Oricalcite shine.<lf>Any one of them is missing, and it's a wash.
<string>We need Yabran to be harvesting oil at full blast,<lf>but for some reason, he's stuck on a simmer...
<string>Name one thing in this world that shines brighter<lf>than our passion for the festival. You can't.
<string>I feel bad saying it, but some of the Bonefolk are<lf>fed up with Yabran being so spineless.
<string>Have you met Maki? She's the Oilfolk<lf>gal who just ran out of the village.
<string>I wish Yabran would take a look at her and<lf>remember the spark he used to have.
<string>Maki's run off again.
<string>You saw her, didn't ya? Flyin' out of here. She's<lf>been like that awhile now.
<string>She'll get in a fight with Yabran, then take off<lf>running, come back with no auric oil, and repeat...
<string>You planning on going after her?<lf>Take some friendly advice and don't.
<string>This time of the season, there are<lf>gas-spewing monsters out there.
<string>Can't blame her for being worried for the tribe...
<string>Sure, I want to make the festival a success.<lf>But Maki can't harvest all the auric oil alone.
<string>Lately, it's been hard to look to the Everforge<lf>and tell ourselves, "This time, for sure..."
<string>Why won't Yabran rally the whole<lf>tribe to go get the oil we need?
<string>That's a curious tool you're carting around,<lf>traveler. It's certainly <ITALIC>big.</ITALIC> What's it used for?
<string>...<ITALIC>Monsters?</ITALIC> It's for dealing with monsters? Huh...<lf>That wouldn't have been in my first hundred guesses.
<string>How does this work? What powers it?
<string>This place is amazing! So many moving pieces<lf>and questions about how it all works!
<string>Steam? Oil hydraulics?<lf>It sure as heck can't be water.
<string>Bet you can't wait to explore.
<string>Yep! But don't worry, I'll still do my job.<lf>And this region's got no shortage of ore.
<string>If you find anything interesting, bring it by<lf>and we'll see if I can use it in your gear.
<string>Oh, hey. Were you able to ask about the Keepers?<lf>No leads on the White Wraith, I'm afraid.
<string>We know it left the forest, but...<lf>not a single soul here has seen it.
<string>The only other logical place it could have gone<lf>is the desert—that's my thought, at least.
<string>I'll ask around here a bit more, just to be sure.
<string>Thanks, Olivia.
<string>But... You sure you don't wanna have<lf>a look around like your companions?
<string>Duty comes first. But I appreciate the thought.
<string>So what's your take? How do you<lf>think they power this thing?
<string>The Everforge? You got me.
<string>It lights up for their festival, right?<lf>Something to do with some Firespring?
<string>So where does this fire come from,<lf>and what makes it "spring"?
<string>What do you think they even make with it,<lf>uh...what's-your-name? From the... uh...
<string>Avis Unit! You're the Avis hunter... Right, right.
<string>Sorry, I try not to clutter my brain with<lf>unnecessary details. Not worth the energy.
<string>Energy is finite, and I choose to use mine<lf>to get to the bottom of this Everforge.
<string>Have you seen all the incredible monster<lf>materials they work with here?
<string>It's pretty impressive, all right.
<string>In olden times, they used to harvest<lf>materials on a much larger scale.
<string>The way they tell it, this is just them<lf>"scraping by with what they can find."
<string>I'd give an arm and a leg to see how they were<lf>able to rake in so many materials in the old days.
<string>They must have figured out something... But what...?
<string>Maki, where did you go this time...?
<string>Hm? Who are you?
<string>Hello. You must be the Oilfolk chief.
<string>Greetings. We were hoping we might have a word.<lf>My name is Alma.
<string>I'm Nata.
<string>Greetings. My name is Alma.<lf>Do you think we could have a word?
<string>We're part of an expedition. My friends and I<lf>are here looking for something.
<string>A pleasure to meet you.
<string>It is good to see you again, Chief Yabran.
<string>Zatoh. Still kicking, I see. Who are these people?
<string>Trustworthy friends. They saved Kunafa<lf>in our hour of need.
<string>That so? Managed to impress even you, hmm?
<string>Have you ever heard of the Keepers?
<string>Where was that girl running off to?
<string>What's this Firespring Festival?
<string>(End Conversation)
<string>We're searching for this boy's home. Have you<lf>ever heard of the Keepers?
<string>Keepers? Can't say that I have, but—hm?<lf>Is that a Wylkstone pendant?
<string>Hmm, no...not quite. And yet it strikes<lf>me as very similar.
<string>Some time ago, I heard about an object that<lf>served as the Wylkstone's counterpart.
<string>Do you know where it's produced?
<string>Hardly. But long ago, the population thrived and<lf>had access to more advanced technology.
<string>Perhaps these Keepers are what remain of a tribe<lf>with connections to that ancient age.
<string>My village is at the end of an underground tunnel.
<string>Lots of tunnels 'round here.<lf>I'll see if I can find you a guide.
<string>Where was that girl headed earlier?
<string>Maki? She went to gather auric oil.<lf>It's needed for the Firespring Festival.
<string>She's desperate to see our tribe succeed.<lf>Won't listen to a damn thing I say...
<string>May I ask why you're against her going?
<string>Because...some things are more important.
<string>Enough of that. Problem is, the gathering site<lf>is crawling with monsters this time of year.
<string>If Roqul knew what was good for him,<lf>he'd have brought her home!
<string>I heard you ignite your Everforge during<lf>the Firespring Festival?
<string>We use the tremendous heat from the Firespring<lf>to produce Azuz's specialty, Oricalcite.
<string>However, the quality of the Oricalcite hinges entirely<lf>on the integrity of the materials used to forge it.
<string>Recently, the Oilfolk's offerings haven't been<lf>up to snuff. Lackluster, they say.
<string>Bah! As if I care! I don't. Care.
<string>So the girl is heading right into a monster den?
<string>If I may be so bold, might I propose<lf>that we go look for Maki?
<string>What? I can't go sending guests to their deaths.
<string>But... Well...
<string>You seem like a tough lot.<lf>If you can, I'd be grateful.
<string>Good. No sign of monsters approaching today, either.
<string>The smell of smoke keeps Azuz safe<lf>from any monsters sniffing about.
<string>It lets us all sleep soundly at night.
<string>We've all gotten used to the smell of<lf>this smoke that repels the monsters.
<string>Can't say the same for the monsters, though.<lf>I wonder why that is.
<string>Pretty amazing that people from the past<lf>were able to find a method like this.
<string>Azuz has an age-old defense mechanism that uses<lf>special smoke to hide us from the monsters.
<string>Azuz is the only place with the equipment to<lf>make it, though, so be careful when leaving!
<string>The smoke may be useful in repelling monsters,<lf>but it's hard to produce.
<string>Only Azuz's equipment can do it, so we<lf>unfortunately can't take it on the road.
