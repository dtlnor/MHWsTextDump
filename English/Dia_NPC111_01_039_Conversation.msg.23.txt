<string>So I stopped and gazed out at the scene<lf>before me, savoring my meal...
<string>Hold on... Why'd I come to the Forbidden Lands again?
<string>So there I sat, my line dangling, gazing at<lf>the rippling water, time trickling by...
<string>Hold on... Why'd I come to the Forbidden Lands again?
<string>Fish tend to appear more often in the morning<lf>and evening. Those are the golden hours, as it were.
<string>Try fishing around those times for the best haul.
<string>A lot of fish are only active during certain times.<lf>Like the Great Trevally or the Gastronome Tuna.
<string>So if you're not catching the fish you want,<lf>try going again at a different time of the day.
<string>The trick to attracting fish? I'd say it's gotta<lf>be the long-and-slow approach.
<string>Cast as far as you can and then wind it in slow.<lf>That way, fish near and far will see your lure!
<string>Ah, the peak of elegance...
<string>When a fish jumps, it makes ripples in the water,<lf>right? Like multiple rings spreading out.
<string>After listening to this song, that's exactly how<lf>I imagine voices spread across the world.
<string>What a fascinating voice... It's like the morning,<lf>but also like the dark of night...
