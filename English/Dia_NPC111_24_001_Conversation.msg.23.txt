<string>Greetings, Avis Unit Hunter. Let's keep warm and<lf>make today count.
<string>Were my brothers well, last you saw?
<string>They say you can transcend hot or cold by practicing<lf>mind over matter. ...But <ITALIC>dang,</ITALIC> it's cold.
<string>They say you can transcend hot or cold by<lf>practicing mind over matter. So, about that...
<string>I'm racing to reach enlightenment at record pace.
<string>This sure is another region with extreme weather.
<string>Pleasure to meet you. I'm in charge of provisions<lf>for the Base Camp here.
<string>Whether it's frostbit fingers or chills down your<lf>spine, I've got the cure for what ails you, Hunter.
<string>Always nice to see you with that look, Avis<lf>Hunter. It's like I'm basking in sunlight.
<string>I feel like this blizzard is more blizzard-y than<lf>normal. Am I losing it?
<string>May the frost lay a carpet to cushion<lf>your steps, Hunter.
<string>Phew... Gah! I forgot, deep breaths hurt. Shallow<lf>breaths... Shallow breaths...
<string>Wait, Gore Magala, as in <ITALIC>Frenzy virus</ITALIC> Gore Magala?<lf>But that's... No, it does add up.
<string>I heard this place used to be a<lf>Wudwud's secret hideout.
<string>Rove, I think the name was?
<string>I'm sure my brothers are all living it up,<lf>wherever they are right now.
