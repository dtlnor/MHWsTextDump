<string>Hey, you gotta moment?
<string>Sure. Do you need more materials?
<string>No materials this time. Actually, I already have<lf>a prototype put together!
<string>And it's my best work yet! ...Probably. See, I<lf>still haven't had a chance to try it in combat.
<string>A new quest just got added, can we go test it out?
<string>Alright, sounds fun. We can head out as soon as<lf>I'm done getting ready.
<string>Nice job, partner! Thanks for always helping out<lf>with my ideas.
<string>Gemma helped me put together the Rath-from-Above!
<string>I had no idea you two were cooking up something<lf>like this.
<string>Eh heh heh, surprised? If I want to be a top-tier<lf>Palico I need to keep thinking of new ideas!
<string>I'm a lucky hunter.
<string>Right! Ehehe. But my partner is also pretty good!
<string>You can always trust me to have your back!
<string>Thanks. It's a huge help.
<string>Meow-hoo! Now that's what I call a big success!<lf>I'll explain it all back at camp.
