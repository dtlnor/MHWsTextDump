<string>Target sighted.
<string>There. Our mark.
<string>Here it comes.
<string>I'm at your side!
<string>The start of another hunt.
<string>Wait, did I bring ammo...?
<string>That's a big one.
<string>This one's unusually large.
<string>Pretty small.
<string>This one's unusually tiny.
<string>Sorry...pulling back!
<string>It still isn't...my time...
<string>Is this...where I...?
<string>I've returned.
<string>Let's try this again.
<string>There. A bomb.
<string>Light it up.
<string>Trap, set.
<string>Here's a trap.
<string>Pulled it together?
<string>There, now back to work.
<string>You need this.
<string>Use this to step up.
<string>Flash!
<string>Cover your eyes, I'll rob them of sight!
<string>Sonic bomb!
<string>Cover your ears, I'll deafen our mark!
<string>Firing dung pod!
<string>Forcing it to move!
<string>It's not your time just yet.
<string>Can you keep going?
<string>Hold strong. I'll do all that I can.
<string>Incoming! Evade!
<string>Fall back! Now!
<string>Nice to have someone you can trust.
<string>Thank you.
<string>You're a good one.
<string>Look. Nearly there.
<string>Careful, the beaten bite the hardest.
<string>It's trapped!
<string>It's wide open!
<string>Target down! Aim: fully locked!
<string>That's our cue. Commencing barrage!
<string>Mounted! Leave it to me!
<string>You're not shaking me off.
<string>Monster part destroyed? Well, well...
<string>Well, now... You're as good as they say.
<string>We can't let it get away.
<string>Deep breaths.
<string>Where's it going?
<string>Do we pursue straight away?
<string>Thank you.
<string>Take care, then.
<string>I'll be on my way.
<string>Kinda hungry...
<string>Thank you. A fine bit of work.
<string>See you.
<string>Today is a fine day.
<string>A superlative result.
<string>I still have room to improve.
<string>I'm glad we managed, in the end.
<string>Time to extract? Very well.
<string>Returning to base.
<string>Making for the next target.
<string>Ammo stores: sufficient. Continuing the hunt.
<string>I'm here!
<string>Tak, I'll join you!
<string>Oh, Avis. That's reassuring.
<string>Tak, entering combat.
<string>'Tis nothing to fight these monsters...
<string>Oh, perhaps I should be more perceptive of others today.
<string>I set up a meat trap.
<string>Does this one eat meat?
<string>Ready to lure it into the trap.
<string>Over here. Let's trap it.
<string>Neither of us is meant to die here today.
<string>Move or you'll die!
<string>Please, you must dodge this one!
<string>Where are you off to?
<string>Attack! There's no other logical choice!
<string>Now it strikes back, as it fights for its life...
<string>This one'll hurt if it hits you...
<string>Let's go! It's life or death!
<string>Can't pass this up!
<string>One right after the other...
<string>Let them quarrel amongst themselves.
<string>It took the bait!
<string>Fell for it.
<string>Am I being summoned? As you wish... Haha.
<string>Yours is the path of light, Hunter.<lf>Follow it always.
