<string>(somebody mumbling)
<string>A Nerscylla.
<string>What is that?
<string>Ah, now death greets me with a new mask.
<string>Or are you my salvation?
<string>So what shall it be, should I leave it to fate?
<string>No!
<string>We're gonna save you!
<string>This is clearly a job for the Guild.
<string>I squirm. I struggle. Ergo, I am.
<string>Faced with death, I am finally, truly alive.
<string>Hunter! In order to rescue the Lynian<lf>and secure the surrounding area,
<string>the Guild authorizes you to hunt that Nerscylla!
<string>I'm on it.
<string>We'll be back at camp.
