<string>You wish to know what runs through this head<lf>of mine?
<string>Fishing! Nonstop angle-mania!
<string>I find myself a long way from home, but I don't<lf>regret it. Even with bouts of homesickness.
<string>I must remember, a fish never swims backwards!
<string>The horror! Without a perfect pool in which<lf>to cast my lure, how am I to catch a whopper?
<string>Tell me, Avis Hunter! What shall I do?
<string>The day I heard rumor of a forest of water...<lf>I was as if a woman possessed!
<string>My senses and my fishing lure are sharpened to a<lf>razor's edge. The day I bag a whopper is nigh...
<string>Ah, I suppose I should introduce myself.<lf>I'm the Rubrum Unit Handler, Kanya. It's a pleasure!
<string>So these Wudwuds... I wonder if their diets are<lf>comprised of fish.
<string>There may be some avid anglers among them.
<string>Of all the times to appear, the White Wraith<lf>chose the Downpour... That feels significant.
<string>Most land-dwelling species tend to avoid getting<lf>soaked by rain.
<string>And the Wraith doesn't appear to be aquatic...
<string>Hello, Avis Hunter. Taking a break?
<string>If a flock of Yian Kut-ku is present, it's proof<lf>the region is flourishing.
<string>I wonder if the same holds true for fish.
<string>Ugh, has the Fallow not lingered long enough?
<string>If the fish you were marking only showed up in<lf>this rain, would you still go after it? Or no?
<string>Uth Duna may be a frightening powerhouse<lf>of a monster.
<string>But the beauty of such aquatic monsters<lf>is utterly hypnotizing.
<string>What am I doing, now that the rain's finally<lf>cleared up?
<string>Fishing! Nonstop angle-mania!
<string>And what will I partake in from now to eternity?
<string>Fishing! Nonstop angle-mania!
<string>I have formed a fisherfellowship with the Wudwud<lf>fishing chief. No words, just us and our lines.
<string>No finer way to spend a day.

<string>A new frontier of nonstop angle-mania, and a fine<lf>fisherfellow to swap stories with!
<string>This is what life is all about.
<string>Are you angling today, fisherfellow?
<string>You can bet I am. I need to really lock in here<lf>if I don't want to get left in your wake!
<string>Ahh, nothing beats a day spent fishing—don't say<lf>a word, I know you agree!
