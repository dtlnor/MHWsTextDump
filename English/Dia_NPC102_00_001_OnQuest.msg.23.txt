<string>Now commencing quest, by order of the Guild.
<string>Commencing quest now. Are you prepared?
<string>Let's have another hunt with no surprises today.
<string>We've received permission from the Guild.<lf>Let's get hunting!
<string>Target sighted! Engage at your discretion!
<string>Now engaging with the target!
<string>Our task is to capture the monster. Take care<lf>not to slay it.
<string>We've been charged with slaying the target.<lf>Capturing it isn't an option.
<string>We were trusted with this request. Let's see it<lf>through.
<string>Excellent work. That's another quest complete.
<string>Nicely done, Hunter. Glad you're in one piece.
<string>It's always a treat to watch you work, Hunter.
<string>Let's continue our investigation. I'll compile<lf>the results.
<string>Well done, Hunter. Now let's continue our investigation.
<string>A supply shipment's come in. Hope you find something useful!
<string>They've issued us supplies. Let's put them to use.
<string>All the items we need to capture the target have<lf>been supplied.
<string>Those supplies will help with this quest. Let's be<lf>sure to use them.
<string>More supplies have been added.
<string>We've been given more supplies. Check your<lf>Seikret's pouch.
<string>I'll take back any extra supplies.
<string>Supplies are meant to be used. No need to hold<lf>back.
<string>Looks like the monster dropped something.
<string>Make sure to grab anything a monster leaves behind!
<string>Remember to carve that severed part.
<string>Don't forget you can carve materials from<lf>severed parts!
<string>You can carve materials off of small monsters as well.
<string>I'll put the materials I gathered in your item box.
<string>I gathered some materials, too.<lf>Check your field pouch.
<string>We'll find the materials we're after here.
<string>I'll be standing by at camp, then.
<string>I'll fall back for now. Please do be careful.
<string>I'll head back to camp for now!
<string>I'll support you.
<string>Joining up.
<string>Hope I didn't keep you.
<string>It's dangerous here! Please clear the area!
<string>This thing's a trove of new data.
<string>This is a rare research opportunity. Can't let it<lf>go to waste.
<string>It's fast asleep.
<string>Might want to take it easy. We don't want it<lf>waking up...
<string>Just give me the word if you decide you want<lf>your Palico's help.
<string>The people of Kunafa call Rey Dau, "Destruction's<lf>Knell." ...It's no mystery why.
<string>Is that creature holding something?
<string>The lightning's being absorbed. Seems this area<lf>is safe.
<string>Every hair on my body's standing on end... There's<lf>an unbelievable amount of elemental energy here!
<string>Flesh rots, carrion feeds the scavengers, and the<lf>bones remain... All part of the cycle of life.
<string>What do you suppose this is? It looks quite old.
<string>What a breathtaking view.
<string>Places like these always make me feel small.
<string>What forces could have shaped it this way?
<string>Wherever you go, mankind's ways stay the same.
<string>Amazing how monsters and humans always find<lf>a way to survive.
<string>Those must be people from Kunafa.
<string>Threat inbound! Get outside!
<string>Threat inbound! We need to get clear of here!
<string>Fascinating.
<string>Amazing...!
<string>This is serious!
<string>Be careful!
<string>Look, Hunter!
<string>What could that be?
<string>Do you hear something?
<string>I see.
<string>It's lovely.
<string>This feels great.
<string>You really did it up!
<string>Nice work, grillmaster.
<string>This still looks good!
<string>Look at the size of this!
<string>Oh! You snagged a rare one!
