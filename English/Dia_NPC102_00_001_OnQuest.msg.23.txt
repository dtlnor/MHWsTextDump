<string>Now commencing quest, by order of the Guild.
<string>Commencing quest now. Are you prepared?
<string>Let's have another hunt with no surprises today.
<string>We've received permission from the Guild.<lf>Let's get hunting!
<string>Target sighted! Engage at your discretion!
<string>Now engaging with the target!
<string>Our task is to capture the monster. Take care<lf>not to slay it.
<string>We've been charged with slaying the target.<lf>Capturing it isn't an option.
<string>We were trusted with this request. Let's see it<lf>through.
<string>Excellent work. That's another quest complete.
<string>Nicely done, Hunter. Glad you're in one piece.
<string>It's always a treat to watch you work, Hunter.
<string>Let's continue our investigation. I'll compile<lf>the results.
<string>Well done, Hunter. Now let's continue our investigation.
<string>A supply shipment's come in.<lf>Hope you find something useful!
<string>They've issued us supplies. Let's put them to use.
<string>All the items we need to capture the target have<lf>been supplied.
<string>Those supplies will help with this quest.<lf>Let's be sure to use them.
<string>More supplies have been added.
<string>We've been given more supplies. <lf>Check your Seikret's pouch.
<string>I'll take back any extra supplies.
<string>Supplies are meant to be used. No need to hold<lf>back.
<string>Looks like the monster dropped something.
<string>Make sure to grab anything a monster leaves behind!
<string>Remember to carve that severed part.
<string>Don't forget you can carve materials<lf>from severed parts!
<string>You can carve materials off of small monsters as well.
<string>I'll put the materials I gathered in your item box.
<string>I gathered some materials, too.<lf>Check your field pouch.
<string>We'll find the materials we're after here.
<string>I'll be standing by at camp, then.
<string>I'll fall back for now. Please do be careful.
<string>I'll head back to camp for now!
<string>I'll support you.
<string>Joining up.
<string>Hope I didn't keep you.
<string>It's dangerous here! Please clear the area!
<string>This thing's a trove of new data.
<string>This is a rare research opportunity. Can't let it<lf>go to waste.
<string>It's fast asleep.
<string>Might want to take it easy. We don't want it<lf>waking up...
<string>Ooooh! An egg. Wanna take it in to study? If that's<lf>the case, please deliver it to the camp.
<string>Uh, oh! Looks like the egg's parent has caught<lf>on to us!
<string>The egg!
<string>Egg delivery complete. The Guild researchers will<lf>take it from here.
<string>Just give me the word if you decide you want<lf>your Palico's help.
<string>The people of Kunafa call Rey Dau, "Destruction's<lf>Knell." ...It's no mystery why.
<string>It's an Uth Duna! A leviathan as terrifying as it<lf>is beautiful.
<string>The Black Flame of yore!
<string>The size of it... It's terrifying just to behold.
<string>What's Arkveld doing out here...?
<string>Is that creature holding something?
<string>The lightning's being absorbed. Seems this area<lf>is safe.
<string>Take care the current doesn't sweep your legs out<lf>from under you.
<string>Gemma would be all over this...
<string>How do you suppose these work...?
<string>The Guardian in this cocoon seems just about<lf>ready to hatch. Even the slightest provocation...
<string>Every hair on my body's standing on end... There's<lf>an unbelievable amount of elemental energy here!
<string>Flesh rots, carrion feeds the scavengers, and the<lf>bones remain... All part of the cycle of life.
<string>What do you suppose this is? It looks quite old.
<string>What a breathtaking view.
<string>Places like these always make me feel small.
<string>What forces could have shaped it this way?
<string>This place is a massive reservoir of water.
<string>Do you suppose this place was<lf>once a workshop, too?
<string>Such interesting architecture. It's nothing<lf>like anything I've seen back west.
<string>This vista's been unchanged since ancient times.<lf>Past and present really aren't so far removed...
<string>Wherever you go, mankind's ways stay the same.
<string>Amazing how monsters and humans always find<lf>a way to survive.
<string>Those must be people from Kunafa.
<string>Those Wudwuds never change, do they?
<string>Strange to see the Stonefolk out here.
<string>The Oilfolk are looking busy today,<lf>I see.
<string>It's the Bonefolk. Hard at work, as ever.
<string>Is...that Rove?
<string>Keepers... I suppose this is another part<lf>of their way of life.
<string>Threat inbound! Get outside!
<string>Threat inbound! We need to get clear of here!
<string>Fascinating.
<string>Amazing...!
<string>This is serious!
<string>Be careful!
<string>Look, Hunter!
<string>What could that be?
<string>Do you hear something?
<string>I see.
<string>It's lovely.
<string>This feels great.
<string>These all look so tasty!
<string>Mm, so tasty!
<string>This still looks good!
<string>Look at the size of this!
<string>Oh! You snagged a rare one!
<string>We don't have the Guild's authorization to hunt <lf>that monster. Let's look for another target.
<string>We have yet to receive orders from the<lf>Guild to hunt that monster.
<string>We aren't authorized to hunt that monster.<lf>How about tackling a different quest instead?
<string>Finding good footing in sandy terrain can be tricky.<lf>Fortunately, the same goes for monsters.
<string>Take a look at these ruins. Perhaps they<lf>once served as dwellings.
<string>The water over there seems pretty deep.<lf>I bet it's brimming with fish.
<string>Look at the size of that structure!
<string>Watch your feet in this oilsilt.
<string>What intense heat! It's dangerous to linger on<lf>the lava!
<string>You can see the wall's interior in some places.<lf>It almost appears as if... No, it can't be...
<string>I can hardly even imagine what a structure like<lf>this would be used for.
<string>So this is where you've been living, Rove.
<string>What a truly magnificent tree.<lf>I'm sure it has quite the storied history.
<string>So this is where the Landspine, or rather, the<lf>Wyrmways all begin.
<string>The Wyvern Milk seems to be leaking out in irregular<lf>locations.
<string>Look, you can see vague outlines of the dormant<lf>Guardians in their cocoons...
<string>Please be careful. The weather is changing rapidly!
<string>Stay alert. The weather is unpredictable.
<string>A Frenzied monster! Be careful, it'll be more<lf>aggressive than normal!
<string>A Tempered monster! Look at the size of that scar.
<string>Another Arkveld! So the species found a<lf>way to prevail after all.
<string>According to the people of Azuz, Gelidron<lf>are a great source of quality meat.
<string>Try dispersing the pack by firing a Large<lf>Dung Pod!
<string>Hunter, it looks like our target<lf>is about to leave the area.
<string>A potential target has appeared.<lf>Check your map when you're ready.
<string>Ugh... Egh...
<string>You did it!
<string>Seems like your weapon has a skill attached, too.<lf>It might be a good idea to take a look.
<string>Let's be sure to prepare thoroughly before heading<lf>to our next destination.
<string>Let's set out after making sure<lf>we've left nothing unfinished.
<string>Are you all right? Take a second to restock<lf>your supplies before heading out.
<string>I'm glad you're all right. Don't worry, you'll<lf>get them next time.
<string>That was an unexpectedly fierce monster.<lf>Let's try again after some preparation.
<string>I have no doubt in your skills, Hunter. But maybe<lf>we should try preparing a bit more first.
<string>The weather is getting increasingly worse!<lf>Exercise caution!
<string>I'm glad you're all right. Take a second to restock<lf>your supplies before heading out, OK?
<string>More plentiful flora brings with it more methods<lf>for recovery.
<string>I'm rooting for you! You can do it!
<string>It's about to start! Ooh, I'm so excited!
<string>Wow, congratulations!<lf>You had this one in the bag.
<string>What a performance, Hunter!<lf>It was so riveting.
<string>First place! Incredible!
<string>Way to pull that victory out of the water!<lf>Talk about a nail-biter.
<string>Aw, you were so close!<lf>Next one's in the bag for sure.
<string>You did great. Keep at it!
<string>You can use what you learned today<lf>to grow even more.
<string>It's not the result we were hoping for,<lf>but there's always next time.
<string>To think fishing could cause tears of joy!
<string>I am so, SO proud of you! You had the smarts,<lf>you had the skills, and you delivered.
<string>Good luck! I know you can do it!
<string>Safe hunting!
<string>There's a special event going on at the<lf>Grand Hub. Should we check it out?
<string>A special event? That sounds fun!
<string>Aha! I always knew you were a fellow admirer<lf>of history's lost relics.
<string>Is that a— Oh my goodness.<lf>I've never laid eyes on such a find!
<string>OK, let's be on our way.
<string>Do you have everything?
<string>Guild-authorized target sighted.<lf>You may commence the hunt.
<string>Transitioning to the quest.<lf>Are you ready?
<string>Nice work, Hunter!<lf>Let's head back.
<string>Quest complete! You were amazing, as always.
<string>Since we're here, let's poke around a bit more.
<string>Understood. Let's continue the investigation.
<string>The Guild sent us supply items.
<string>We received supply items.<lf>Don't let them go to waste.
<string>This weather is unrelenting...<lf>We'll just have to tough it out.
<string>Be careful out there, Pard.
<string>Nice work, Pard. I'll be sure to make you<lf>look good in my report.
<string>An exciteshroom... Was this one of the<lf>"do eats" or the "don't eats"?
