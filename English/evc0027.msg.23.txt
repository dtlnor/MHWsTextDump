<string>How is he?
<string>He's calmed down.
<string>Says he'd rather be alone.
<string>It's the first time I've seen him this upset... Poor kid.
<string>He'll be OK.
<string>Hey.
<string>There's something I need to show you.
<string>It's back there.
<string>Go ahead. I'll watch the entrance.
<string>Why's it glowing?
<string>No clue, but I noticed it when setting up camp.
<string>So this is what Werner was going on about...
<string>Yeah, it looks just like what we saw in Azuz.
<string>Except this one's glowing...
<string>So...
<string>Where do you think it goes?
<string>Hey guys!
<string>The sandstorm died down!
<string>Good, we can go back outside.
<string>Huh?
<string>Uh, it stopped glowing...
