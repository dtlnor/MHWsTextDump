<string>How's it going?
<string>A lot's happened, to understate it. But the only<lf>reason we're still here happily working is you.
<string>So I figured I'd kit out the forge here<lf>to smelt armor spheres for you.
<string>I'd also like to give you your fair share<lf>of the Oricalcite we produced.
<string>So yeah, drop by anytime. I'll be waiting.
<string>Oh, right. I modified the forge again. Get this—<lf>it can smelt ore now!
<string>As long as you've got the materials, it's ready to<lf>go anytime. So don't be a stranger, yeah?
<string>Anything I can make for ya?
<string>I've got something for ya.
<string>Come anytime ya need something.
<string>See ya.
<string>Let's get started.
<string>What can I get ya today?
<string>Now this is the stuff!
<string>Betcha can make use of that.
<string>Time to get started!
<string>You got it!
<string>Don't be shy now!
<string>Take it. It's yours.
