<string>So, why'd you come here?
<string>Sometimes I like to feel the weight of obligation.
<string>You haven't changed one bit.
<string>So a Jin Dahaad was sighted in the Iceshard Cliffs?
<string>Yeah, one of our people ran into it.<lf>Apparently it was fighting some other monster.
<string>Dang... Glad everyone's all right.
<string>...Binoculars?
<string>Yep. Helps you differentiate the size of large<lf>monsters at a glance.
<string>We got someone who can differentiate<lf>them just based on instinct.
<string>Have you ever seen a Guardian carcass?
<string>Sure have. One that had already crystalized.
<string>I couldn't stop staring at the crystal I got from it.<lf>It's like I was holding its life force in my hand.
<string>Your camp got destroyed? Why not fix it yourselves?<lf>That's what my unit would do.
<string>We're leaving it until the Support Team<lf>can come and set things straight.
<string>But that'll take a while, won't it?
<string>Yeah, but our hunter doesn't like to bother<lf>with things like that if he doesn't have to.
<string>We got a few good hits on the Jin Dahaad in the<lf>Iceshard Cliffs, but it fled to Rimechain Peak.
<string>Huh... Might be able to make it a Field Survey then.
<string>Yeah, that'll make it easier to stop it from<lf>affecting the surroundings, too.
<string>Now, what do you think we do when we want<lf>to dye fabric the same color as that flower?
<string>Umm... Do you boil the petals or something?
<string>We boil the tree branches and bark. Impressive,<lf>isn't it? The tree itself carries the color.
<string>Well, guess this isn't too bad.
<string>I guess...
<string>Hey, what's your real name?
<string>My real name? What do you mean?
<string>Aww, c'mon. And here I thought this was<lf>the perfect moment to get it out of you.
<string>Is it true you're responsible for the design<lf>of those imposing statues?
<string>Hmm... Maybe.
<string>Oh, come on. Why not tell me?
<string>Did you see those Wudwuds dancing around? With FIRE?<lf>They really get into it, even in this heat.
<string>I couldn't do it. My entire unit does not do well with heat,<lf>or the sun for that matter...
<string>Oh yeeeah, that's right.
<string>Rumor has it there are gremlins that come out at<lf>night during the Plenty and burn everything to a crisp!
<string>You mean Wudwuds? That's just how they cook.
<string>Yeah... That sounds about right.
<string>OK, spill it. What are your real names?
<string>Sorry, not happening.
<string>Aw, come on. Here I thought these were the perfect<lf>vibes for letting the Felyne out of the bag.
<string>You guys seeing these Felyne-looking<lf>things wandering around?
<string>Yeah...
<string>So it's not just me...
<string>Feels like we're kinda out of place here, doesn't it?
<string>Really? I'm pretty comfortable.
<string>That tracks. Those flowers probably make you<lf>Aurora folks feel right at home, huh.
<string>It's so sparkly!
<string>Very sparkly.
<string>A little too sparkly?
<string>No stinking way. That's a Felyne.
<string>No no, it's a Seikret. No question.
<string>What? But— I can't tell if you're pulling<lf>my chain or not.
<string>This festival has a star theme, yes?<lf>Reminds me of that Research Commission.
<string>The one that was full of geniuses, weirdos,<lf>and troublemakers?
<string>Hm...yes. That is the one to which I refer.
