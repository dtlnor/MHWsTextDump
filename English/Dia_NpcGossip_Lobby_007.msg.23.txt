<string>So, why'd you come here?
<string>Sometimes I like to feel the weight of obligation.
<string>You haven't changed one bit.
<string>So a Jin Dahaad was sighted in the Iceshard Cliffs?
<string>Yeah, one of our people ran into it.<lf>Apparently it was fighting some other monster.
<string>Dang... Glad everyone's all right.
<string>...Binoculars?
<string>Yep. Helps you differentiate the size of large<lf>monsters at a glance.
<string>We got someone who can differentiate<lf>them just based on instinct.
<string>Have you ever seen a Guardian carcass?
<string>Sure have. One that had already crystalized.
<string>I couldn't stop staring at the crystal I got from it.<lf>It's like I was holding its life force in my hand.
<string>Your camp got destroyed? Why not fix it yourselves?<lf>That's what my unit would do.
<string>We're leaving it until the Support Team<lf>can come and set things straight.
<string>But that'll take a while, won't it?
<string>Yeah, but our hunter doesn't like to bother<lf>with things like that if he doesn't have to.
<string>We got a few good hits on the Jin Dahaad in the<lf>Iceshard Cliffs, but it fled to Rimechain Peak.
<string>Huh... Might be able to make it a Field Survey then.
<string>Yeah, that'll make it easier to stop it from<lf>affecting the surroundings, too.

<string>Now, what do you think we do when we want<lf>to dye fabric the same color as that flower?
<string>Umm... Do you boil the petals or something?
<string>We boil the tree branches and bark. Impressive,<lf>isn't it? The tree itself carries the color.
<string>Well, guess this isn't too bad.
<string>I guess...
<string>Hey, what's your real name?
<string>My real name? What do you mean?
<string>Aww, c'mon. And here I thought this was<lf>the perfect moment to get it out of you.
