<string>Howdy, Avis Hunter. Fancy a restock before you<lf>head back out?
<string>Did my brothers seem well, last you saw them?
<string>Stay in this place awhile, and you start<lf>forgetting all about the outside world.
<string>You must be the Avis Unit hunter. I'm in charge of<lf>provisioning the Base Camp here. Nice to meet you.
<string>The Keepers' village, at last. Quite the unique<lf>place... I feel like I stumbled into a fairy tale.
<string>I'm so glad for Nata. I've been teary-eyed here<lf>since I heard.
<string>Better make this restock quick, Hunter! And<lf>please, be careful out there!
<string>I'll take care to ensure the people of the village<lf>don't panic when they learn about the White Wraith.
<string>If you're looking for the Astrum Unit, they made<lf>for the Iceshard Cliffs Base Camp.
<string>Apologies, I still haven't quite wrapped my head<lf>around it all yet. Guardians, man-made monsters...
<string>What path you suppose the Keepers will choose<lf>from here on out?
<string>Whatever they decide is their prerogative, but<lf>I hope they take their time and make a good choice.
<string>Huh? The weather's going crazy across the other<lf>regions? It's been quiet as ever here.
<string>It's always the very picture of tranquility here.<lf>It makes Wyveria feel almost outside of time.
<string>I'm glad I came to this Base Camp. It's given me<lf>a front-row view of Wyveria's history.
<string>Are my brothers all doing well? I'd love for them<lf>to come see the village, but that might be tough.
