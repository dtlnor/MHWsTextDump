<string>Hunter! We've received word of sightings<lf>of an unidentified monster.
<string>I'm told it flashes its prey with light and spews poison.<lf>Which matches the description of a monster that the Guild is quite familiar with.
<string>Apparently it's often sighted when this region is in<lf>a Season of Fallow. Perhaps we should investigate?
