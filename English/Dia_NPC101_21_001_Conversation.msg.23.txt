<string>Hey. How goes it?
<string>Hope those little twerps are doing all right...<lf>Oh, sorry. Thinking of my kid brothers.
<string>You might see 'em before I do. Tell 'em their<lf>brother says "hi," yeah?
<string>Yo. Working hard?
<string>Got everything you need? Make sure<lf>you never go in underprepared, now.
<string>I'm the oldest of five brothers. Somehow, we all<lf>wound up in the same line of work.
<string>We all got pretty similar faces, too. Random<lf>folks are always telling me I look familiar.
<string>I like to play a little game to try and figure out<lf>which of us they know. It's kinda fun, heh heh.
<string>It's so nice out today. Perfect for a stroll.
<string>Guess the storm blows away worries along with all<lf>that sand.
<string>Sorry, I've got zip to offer you.<lf>Give me a little while, yeah?
<string>Brand new location and all that. There's bound<lf>to be a few snags at the outset.
<string>As you can see, I work in provisions. My job's to<lf>get you what you need to do <ITALIC>yours.</ITALIC>
<string>Protocol demands that I charge you for it, but I<lf>guarantee you'll get your zenny's worth.
<string>Hope to be seeing a lot of you.
<string>Phew, wasn't sure we'd make it to this point,<lf>but... Welcome to our grand opening, Hunter.
<string>It honestly wouldn't have happened without you.<lf>The whole Support Team's grateful.
<string>That Alpha Doshaguma or whatever seems like one<lf>rough customer. No discounts for them.
<string>This change in the weather's kind of a shock, huh?<lf>Wouldn't complain if it stayed like this forever.
<string>Hey, I heard the news. You're charging smack into<lf>the middle of the storm?
<string>Then you're gonna need to be more prepared than<lf>ever. Let's hear it. What can I get you?
<string>It sounds like the investigation here's reaching<lf>a fever pitch. Just be careful, yeah?
<string>Not that I doubt you can handle it—course you can.<lf>But that doesn't mean I don't worry.
<string>Around these parts, you just never know... Y'know?
<string>First off, nicely done! You showed that a hunter's<lf>resolve is a hell of a thing.
<string>You can bet the next time I meet up with the<lf>brothers, we'll be talking about you.
<string>Fabius is what you'd call...a model boss!
<string>Top-class hunter, top-class biologist.
<string>But...he's so impressive that I'm too intimidated<lf>to approach him.
<string>This weather's too much... It's gummed up the<lf>whole supply chain.
<string>Don't worry, our stock's holding just fine.
<string>This, uh...Frenzy virus? It's got the scholarly<lf>types all fidgety.
<string>Guess that's researchers and the unknown for ya.
<string>...Can't get too mad, though. I'll bring 'em<lf>a snack in a bit here.
<string>Hey there. You been at it this whole time? I mean,<lf>of course you've been.
<string>Finally got a chance to chat with my little bros a<lf>bit ago, and you were all we talked about.
<string>Because we're all spread out, yeah? Means we've<lf>all seen different episodes of your adventures.
<string>It was pretty interesting patching together<lf>your story.
