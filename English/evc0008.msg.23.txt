<string>Thank you very much.
<string>Yeah, let's go!
<string>(Gemchimes tinkling)
<string>What's that sound? It's so pretty.
<string>That's the gemchimes.
<string>They keep the monsters out of the village.
<string>It's almost like...music!
<string>C'mon.
<string>What's all the fuss about?
<string>Who's that?
<string>What's that on <LSNR "his" "her"> back?
<string>It's huuuuge!
<string>Heeeeey!
<string>I guess they really haven't seen a weapon before...
<string>Ngh!
<string>I'll tell my family to start getting everything ready for you.
<string>Do you mind waiting a little while?
<string>Not at all.
<string>Actually, this might be a good chance to talk to the villagers.
<string>I want to ask them about Nata.
<string>I'll have a look around.
<string>Me too! Me too!
<string>OK. We'll meet up later.
