<string>Hey.
<string>Hey there.
<string>Talking to you gets me fired up.
<string>Wonder how long I can keep going<lf>in this line of work.
<string>It's no surprise, but you're pretty good.
<string>Oh, I've heard all about you.<lf>They say the Avis Hunter flies alone.
<string>We'll get along well.
<string>Guess they've got Quematrice out here, too.
<string>Nata doing all right? Kid's face has been all<lf>doom and gloom.
<string>No big surprise. He's been surrounded by grown-ups<lf>speaking a foreign language this whole time.
<string>Day after day of being poked, prodded, and grilled<lf>would put anyone in a sour mood.
<string>My gut's loud and clear on this one. When Werner's<lf>got that look on his face, do not engage.
<string>Yeesh, I'll stay over here where I'm safe.
<string>Guess melting the ice below the cliffs was easy for<lf>a Firespring hot enough to lure the Black Flame.
<string>Or maybe it was the fire in the bellies of those<lf>Azuz guys that did it. ...Or in you and Nata's?
<string>Sometimes, at times like these, I'm tempted to<lf>hang up the whole hunter biz.
<string>But for all the pain, I know I just can't quit.<lf>This gig's a life sentence.
<string>You've got some serious guts on you.
<string>I think it was a good call, myself.
<string>Everywhere's looking ragged right now.
<string>Ehh, close your eyes awhile and it'll all pass.
<string>So, what do you figure Fabius plans to do with<lf>the Dragontorch putting out all this energy?
<string>Me? ...Yeah, I kinda want to head back home.
<string>Pour a couple rounds of the good stuff<lf>down my gullet once I get there.
<string>The hunter life continues to keep its hold on me.

<string>Sometimes I forget that we're in the<lf>Forbidden Lands.
<string>A good meal is our payment for a job well done.<lf>Wait... Or is it the other way around?
<string>Seriously, which is it?
<string>As impressive as ever. No one can compete with you.
<string>I certainly don't intend to, being just<lf>an ordinary hunter and all.
<string>Think I'll sit and dream for a bit.
<string>I have a lot of things I'd like to forget.
<string>Even I can tell how important this ceremony is.
