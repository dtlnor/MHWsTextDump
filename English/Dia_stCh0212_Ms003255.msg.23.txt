<string>Surviving this is going to take<lf>all of our combined power.
<string>Let's take this monster by the horns—er, tentacles.
<string>So uh, where is it?
<string>It retreated beneath the Everforge. I'm guessing<lf>it's at the bottom of the Basin.
<string>Then we'd better get ready!
<string>This is its spoor...
<string>I gave its scent to the scoutflies.
<string>There! The Black Flame!
<string>Leave the Black Flame to the traveler!<lf>We need to focus on diverting all this fire!
<string>We're leaving the Black Flame to you. It kills me<lf>to ask so much of you... I'm sorry.
<string>Just come back in one piece, all right?
<string>Don't worry! The Hunter will come back safe!<lf>Just keep working!
<string>That's it, Maki! Keep it up!
<string>Almost there! The heat may be on,<lf>but Azuz can take it!
<string>I'm not giving up. I won't!
<string>Gemma! Leave this one to me!
<string>Nata, do you need a rest?
<string>This is nothing compared to what<lf>the Hunter's doing... I can do this...!
<string>The Black Flame the foreman was talking about...<lf>What do you s'pose is gonna happen to us?
<string>No, no. I can't get to thinking like that. I've<lf>gotta keep it together.
<string>I remember hearing about the Black Flame as a kid.<lf>That was during another weirdly strong Firespring.
<string>Never really believed something like that was<lf>lurking in the Basin's depths, though.
<string>The heck was that thing? You sure it was a living<lf>animal?
<string>And what do you mean you're gonna <ITALIC>fight</ITALIC> it? Just<lf>who are you?
<string>We don't have time to be worrying about the<lf>Everforge now. I mean, I still <ITALIC>am,</ITALIC> but you know...
<string>Where's the Black Flame?
<string>Let us at it! We'll teach it a lesson!
<string>Perish the thought! Losing you would break<lf>this old woman's heart.
<string>Everybody's scared of the Black Flame. Not me!<lf>I'm gonna go tell it off! I just need to find it first...
<string>I can help out, too!
<string>Did you see how hot the Black Flame burned?
<string>Yeah... It really got my heart racing.
<string>If we make it through this,<lf>you think we could...I dunno...
<string>Huh? Finish that thought...?
<string>Now some Black Whatever's shown up—the whole thing's<lf>a mess. I can't be bothered to feel scared anymore!
<string>Hold up, now some black monster's shown up? Some<lf>kinda...slimy...squiggly guy?
<string>What do you make of that black fiery thing?
<string>I don't know, but we'd best hurry up and<lf>get the old workshop working.
<string>Yeah. We'll keep the area safe.

<string>We must keep Azuz safe at all costs.
<string>That Black Flame thing? Never seen anything like<lf>it before.
<string>I'm all for a good, strong blaze, but burning<lf>everything to the ground? Not here for it.
