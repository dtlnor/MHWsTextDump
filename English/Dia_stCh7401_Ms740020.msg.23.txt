<string>Repairing the nexus... What have we gotten<lf>ourselves into?
<string>Werner must be busy preparing.
<string>I can't believe Werner's going to repair<lf>the nexus... I understand why, but still...
<string>I suppose he'll be preparing.
<string>Hey, Werner. Heading out soon?
<string>Hm? Yeah, any time now.
<string>Azuz has already issued an evacuation order.
<string>Right, yeah, well.
<string>How does the weapon charge energy?
<string>Is this ancient weapon safe?
<string>Who's this "Nadia" person?
<string>(End Conversation)
<string>You mentioned something about charging the weapon.<lf>How does that work, exactly?
<string>Well, I'm sure you know the Wyrmways are<lf>basically a bundle of tube-like fibers, right?
<string>So, what we're going to do is unbundle some<lf>of those fibers into smaller strands.
<string>Then we just have to connect those to the weapon.
<string>It should then start converting the Wyvern Milk<lf>into energy and charging up stage by stage—
<string>And then, you know: Shoot shoot, bang bang.
<string>Basically, the repairs come down to unbundling the<lf>fibers and then improving their stability.
<string>But you have to do it with Gogmazios right there.
<string>Like the boss said: if it gets hairy, we retreat.<lf>There's no point if we wind up dead.
<string>Just don't put yourself in danger.<lf>That's what us hunters are for.
<string>And aren't you just the best?
<string>The boss called this ancient weapon<lf>a "Convergent Elderbreaker."
<string>And it's some tech, that's for sure.<lf>Blows my mind.
<string>Are you sure it's not dangerous?
<string>An odd question from someone who has an implement<lf>of destruction strapped to them at all times.
<string>Technology is a means to an end.<lf>It's neither inherently good nor evil.
<string>Sure, I can conjure up a notion of how the people<lf>of Wyveria used it. But honestly, so what?
<string>Is the weapon out to hurt us?<lf>Does it think for itself? That's my point.
<string>But OK. I'm a cog in the Guild just like you.<lf>I know you need justification to be satisfied.
<string>So, here's a pretty little reason for you:<lf>we're doing this to protect Azuz.
<string>If that's not a hunterly excuse, then I don't<lf>know what is.
<string>This "Nadia" person—she a friend of yours?
<string>Colleague. An old colleague.
<string>She's so gifted that I swear there's something<lf>wrong with her. Especially her marksmanship.
<string>But that's not why she creeps me out.<lf>It's her eyes, and ears, and nose—all of it.
<string>Her instincts are like a wild animal's.<lf>You can't keep a single blasted secret from her.
<string>Please don't leave me alone with her.
<string>Why? Have you got something to hide?
<string>......<lf>Uh, you're missing the point.
<string>We don't need her. Our hunters can handle this just fine.
<string>You and Olivia are plenty capable.
<string>Werner, we've got a BIG problem!
<string>Why? Did you figure out what those pieces are for?
<string>The whole operation just went sideways! After<lf>observing the target, we started to head back...
<string>And then, without any warning, Gogmazios just<lf>vanished! Like it was never there!
<string>So it is able to vanish. Hm...<lf>I see why they call it the Specter.
<string>Our smithy team has already deployed. Said they'll<lf>work on those repairs while it's away.
<string>Good. Now let's discuss posts and formation<lf>for our hunters.
<string>I know it's anomalous, but we'll be conducting<lf>this hunt with <COLOR preset="TXT_Danger">a team of eight</COLOR>.
<string>The site has fair bit of verticality, so we'll post<lf>four hunters each on the lower and upper levels.
<string>The high-ground team—Mina, Kai, Nadia,<lf>and myself—will provide adaptive support.
<string>Yes sir.
<string>You, Olivia, Rosso, and Griffin will focus<lf>on offensive maneuvers.
<string>The goal is to damage the target's back and<lf>dislodge the Convergent Elderbreaker.
<string>Once it is loose, we'll connect it to the<lf>nexus and initiate charging.
<string>How much you charge it is a decision<lf>I leave to you.
<string>Understood.
<string>I will protect the nexus, with Alessa on standby.<lf>If I am incapacitated, you will take my place.
<string>Y-Yes sir.
<string>Once Werner has retreated to a safe distance,<lf>he will give the signal to begin charging.
<string>About those pieces affixed to the Gogmazios...<lf>I think they're an energy release system.
<string>We noticed a small amount of Wyvern Milk<lf>stored inside them.
<string>I wonder if we could use that somehow...
<string>Mm... You all know what must be done.<lf>Take the time now to prepare. Dismissed.
<string>Our preparations are coming along.<lf>I hope everyone else is doing OK.
<string>Let's check in with them as time allows.
<string>We should speak to Fabius, too.
<string>I should go see how everyone is doing.
<string>Don't let it come into contact with<lf>the heavy drakesbone oil...
<string>Think I'm out of form...
<string>Watch out for the drakesbone oil. Once you get<lf>stuck in it, you're asking for a blasting.
<string>What's an avaculation?
<string>What's an avaculation?<lf>Why do we have to do it?
<string>Our job is to take shelter, right?
<string>I'll get the children to safety.<lf>You have my word.
<string>Did you remember to bring along<lf>dragon-element weapons?
<string>Fabius, Nadia, Mina, and Kai will stay on high<lf>ground, guarding the nexus and providing support.
<string>The rest of us hunters will focus on offense.
<string>This whole operation hinges on knocking<lf>the Elderbreaker loose.
<string>That, and Nadia arriving here in time...
<string>Against Gogmazios... That's gonna be crucial.<lf>You might even say "no dragon weapon, no hope."
<string>A fire weapon can soften it up, but we've got Nadia<lf>for that. You can use what's on site in a pinch.
<string>Have you faced a Gogmazios before, Griffin?
<string>Heh heh... I wonder.
<string>Elder dragons are tough beings to categorize.<lf>They're as unpredictable as nature itself.
<string>I hear you've hunted plenty of elder dragons<lf>before, but Gogmazios is a whole other story.
<string>It's the kind of hunt that'll require every<lf>weapon at our disposal to scrape by.
<string>I'm worried about Desi and Werner.<lf>If that thing decides to spring on them...
<string>Honestly, it's a struggle not to freak out.<lf>I wish we could just go already.
<string>Am I worthy to serve as Fabius's backup?
<string>What if something does happen to him?<lf>If the battle turns so overwhelmingly against us?
<string>No... Steady, Alessa. You will weather this storm!
<string>My role in this operation is to take over should<lf>anything happen to Sharpeyes.
<string>This is why I requested to carry a light bowgun.
<string>But just now, I received an order from Fabius<lf>to have all weapon types at the ready.
<string>In other words, I am expected to step in and<lf>fill in the boots of any hunter that falters.
<string>Fabius is calmer and more astute<lf>than any of you give him credit for.
<string>Don't make me have to shoulder another weapon.<lf>I have seen my fill of untimely deaths.
<string>Fire attacks are good for softening up Gogmazios.<lf>After that, dragon-element attacks become crucial.
<string>I know your unit works in secret,<lf>but this is a critical operation.
<string>Can you tell us anything...anything at all<lf>about Gogmazios?
<string>Gogmazios's drakesbone oil can cross between<lf>three states: solid, liquid, and gas.
<string>The gaseous state is especially dangerous.
<string>Unless you suppress its power with dragon attacks,<lf>a moment will come from which there is no escape.
<string>We live or die by the dragon element...
<string>Fire attacks are vital for softening Gogmazios's<lf>armor and dislodging that weapon.
<string>An ancient armament... What did Professor<lf>Fabius call it? The Convergent Elderbreaker?
<string>I still can't believe it's come to this.
<string>The Convergent Elderbreaker... We haven't a hope<lf>unless we can shake that old relic loose.
<string>I got a look from afar, and Werner has it right.<lf>That weapon uses directional energy.
<string>No modern anti-wyvern weapon is equal to it.<lf>But there are weapons with similarities.
<string>With Werner on site, we'll find a way to use it.<lf>He knows more about energy than even me.
<string>I'm curious about those smaller part fragments too,<lf>but...there's just not enough time.
<string>Wish I could go check on Werner, but...<lf>No, I can't...
<string>No one knows where Gogmazios went.
<string>The bigger problem is when it'll come back,<lf>and where... Because if it gets the drop on us...
<string>That, and I hope Olivia doesn't go silent on me again...
<string>......
<string>......Huh? Oh. It's you.<lf>Sorry, I didn't see you coming.
<string>My preparations are complete, my heart is ready.<lf>All that remains is to await the command.
<string>Do not worry about Astrum Unit.<lf>You should see to your own preparations.
<string>Azuz must be kept safe.
<string>Palicoes have been ordered to focus their efforts<lf>on Azuz's defense.
<string>It was the right call. This operation comes<lf>down to teamwork between you hunters.
<string>Griffin will team up with you, Hunter.
<string>Good luck out there. I just know everyone<lf>will return home safely.
<string>Something tells me it's a little late for training<lf>to make any difference...
<string>But I guess it might help us stay calm.
<string>Where you find the courage, I'll never understand.
<string>Once again, Azuz's fate is in your hands.
<string>Where do you find the guts to stand against<lf>these threats? It's mind-boggling.
<string>G-Gogma—what? Elder dragon...?<lf>Hmm, I see.
<string>Funny how learning the name of a threat<lf>makes it frighteningly real in your head.
<string>There's no going back to the days we didn't<lf>know what slumbered beneath us.
<string>Are we better off, or worse?<lf>I don't know.
<string>I'm still struggling to take all this in, but the<lf>focus now is on getting everyone to safety.
<string>I don't need to know any more than that. You can<lf>explain the details when it's over. Good luck.
<string>Nadia? I hear she's on her way.<lf>Hope she makes it in time.
<string>I did a little digging. Dragon element seems most<lf>effective when Gogmazios is in its gas-emitting state.
<string>Be sure to bring a weapon with that<lf>element for when the time comes.
<string>Hunter, what's an elder dragon? Alma tried<lf>to explain them, but I don't understand.
<string>Are they living things the same as you and me?
<string>Several days have passed, and still no<lf>sign of Gogmazios.
<string>It would be wise for our hunters to familiarize<lf>with the terrain before Nadia arrives.
<string>Understood. We'll go have a look.
<string>It's possible Gogmazios might return during<lf>the Firespring. Be prepared for any eventuality.
<string>Hunter, I sense time is short. I'll be extracting the<lf>smithy team. You know what comes next.
<string>Now...are you fully prepared?
<string>As prepared as I'll ever be.
<string>Any final advice about Gogmazios?
<string>I need a little more time.
<string>Good. Then let us go in high spirits.
<string>Gogmazios switches as needed between three states,<lf>with its gas-emitting state being the most perilous.
<string>A dragon-element weapon is essential to<lf>deal with it in that form.
<string>Make doubly sure you are going in prepared.
<string>Very well.
<string>Now, we fight! Put your fears aside!
<string>We'll struggle to dislodge the cannon as<lf>things stand.
<string>Let's start by softening up that monster's hide.<lf>Keep attacking!
<string>This weapon isn't likely to have<lf>much effect right now.
<string>In this state, dragon element<lf>would be more effective.
<string>There! It's working!
<string>No! I'm stuck!
<string>The Compact Anti-Wyvern Guns are exposed!<lf>Use them if you can!
<string>I'll guard the nexus! You focus on attacking!
<string>We've got it covered up here!<lf>You worry about Gogmazios!
<string>Leave this to us! I promise we've got you covered!
<string>We'll protect the nexus. You do your part!
<string>Good luck. You can do this!
<string>It's in your hands. Good luck!
<string>You got this! I'm counting on you, Hunter!
<string>Right! You take it from here!
<string>Tak, you take over!
<string>All units, eyes open! Don't get caught up in it!
<string>The magma is rising!
<string>There are things here you can use!<lf>Come up if the situation presents itself!
<string>We'll never dislodge the Elderbreaker at this rate.
<string>What we need is an opening!<lf>See if you can draw its attention!
<string>Well done! All units, aim for its back!
<string>Let's see if we can stagger it! Target its wingarms!
<string>Target its back!
<string>Excellent! Now target its back!
<string>Weapon has fallen!<lf>Prepare for energy charge!
<string>Hunters, split up! We need someone to distract<lf>Gogmazios while another charges the weapon!
<string>Connect the Elderbreaker to the nexus!
<string>The more connections you make, the greater<lf>the charge speed and output!
<string>That's the nexus! Hook it up!
<string>Good! Now let 'em have it!
<string>You'll need to adjust the direction of fire!
<string>Nice work! All units, hit it with everything you've got!
<string><COLOR FF0000>#Rejected#</COLOR> Dia_stCh7401_Ms740020_0280_t002
<string>My job here is done.
<string><COLOR FF0000>#Rejected#</COLOR> Dia_stCh7401_Ms740020_0281_t002
<string>The rest is up to you. Come back in<lf>one piece, yeah?
<string>It's airborne!
<string>Use your Seikret to pursue it!
<string>We should stock up on ammo while we can!
<string>What's this? I should examine it later.
<string>All units, this is the point of no return!<lf>We finish it off here!
<string>Gogmazios's final form! Use dragon-element<lf>attacks to suppress its power!
<string>Excellent work! All units, attack!
<string>We're not keeping its power in check!<lf>Keep attacking!
<string>We seem to be containing its power!<lf>Keep it up!
<string>We've got its power in check!
<string>It's preparing an attack!
<string>Over here! Get behind me!
<string>Shields up! Brace!
<string>We can still target it from here!<lf>Attack as much as you can!
<string>The Compact Anti-Wyvern Guns can reach it!
<string>We've failed to suppress it...
<string>Almost there! Give it all you've got!
<string>Lay on those attacks! Don't let your courage<lf>fail you now!
<string>It's as formidable as they said...
<string>A fire weapon will make it easier to<lf>soften up Gogmazios.
<string>Listen, once you've softened up Gogmazios, it is susceptible to<lf>attacks from a dragon-element weapon. Make sure you have one.
<string>Late in the battle, your life will depend on it.
<string>Magnificently fought, hunters!
<string>I've never been so proud.<lf>Each and every one of you is worth a thousand of your peers.
<string>Once again, I thank you for your help<lf>slaying that Gogmazios.
<string>We owe this victory to the teamwork of eight<lf>hunters and the combined might of the Guild.
<string>It's an achievement worthy of celebration.
<string>However, we must be cognizant of the fact<lf>that Gogmazios dwell in this land.
<string>We must keep a sharp eye on the Oilwell Basin<lf>and watch for any new anomalies.
<string>Should the Specter reappear, the Guild will unite<lf>anew and deal with it as we now know how.
<string>I will count on you all when that time comes.
<string>But for now...
<string>I only ask that my brave hunters take<lf>a well-deserved rest.
<string>Fine work on a job well done, hunters!<lf>Dismissed!
<string>Congratulations on taking down that Gogmazios.<lf>I'd say you've earned a well-deserved breather, yeah?
<string>Sounds like a good idea.
<string>Now, it's our turn as handlers to take over. We'll split<lf>up and start tackling the mountain of paperwork.
<string>We have to note where it was found, how the fight<lf>unfolded, tactics, habits, habitat...even its lore.
<string>So the world to come knows every detail.
<string>Yes. For years, no one knew why their gunpowder<lf>was going missing.
<string>But knowledge illuminates those mysteries<lf>for the greater good.
<string>Knowledge is progress, and as a handler, my hope<lf>is to be an instrument of that progress.
<string>It's finally over, Hunter. I SERIOUSLY wish elder<lf>dragons would stay the heck away from civilization.
<string>You should've seen how relieved Maki and Yabran<lf>and the others looked. They were like, WHEW!
<string>We're lucky Nadia showed up in time.
<string>I know, right? She kicked all kinds of butt.
<string>After she arrived in Azuz, she took off<lf>like she already knew where to go.
<string>Saved Werner's hide for sure. And I'm glad<lf>you all made it out of there in one piece, too.
<string>What I'm really saying is:<lf>Hunter, you were amazing!
<string>Nice work on that Gogmazios hunt.<lf>I saw how your efforts turned the tides.
<string>...What? Something you'd like to say?
<string>Olivia, when you were protecting Werner<lf>back there, you had me worried.
<string>Yeah... I can understand why.
<string>You told me once about the idea in your head<lf>of what you "should" be.
<string>If that's what you're striving for, then surely<lf>you've gotten close enough. It's time to—
<string>No. Not yet. I have a long way to go.
<string>I know that you must look at me and see a<lf>reckless fool. But I know the path I walk.
<string>And I will not stray from it.
<string>Besides, that person I want to be is fused with<lf>the rest of me. There's no banishing her now.
<string>Well. I hope your path leads you true, Olivia.
<string>Oh, don't look at me like that.<lf>What did I tell you once?
<string>Wherever this journey takes us, Hunter,<lf>our destination will always be the same.
<string>Well, look who it is. Um... Good job back there.
<string>You too, Werner.<lf>I think you took more heat than me.
<string>Maybe.
<string>......
<string>......
<string>Aw, don't look at me like that.<lf>In my head, I was plenty scared.
<string>And believe me, I'm well aware that our<lf>justifications need to have logic behind them.
<string>You and I, at least, need reasons for what<lf>we do. It's what keeps us going.
<string>Not that I care what you think anyway.<lf>Only person I have to answer to is me.
<string>*sigh* Have you at least finally learned my name?
<string>Oh...come on.<lf>What do you take me for?
<string>We've been through thick and thin together,<lf>and still the Hunter doubts!
<string>You're that Hunter from, uh, Draco Unit...
<string>The most amazing hunter around!<lf>...See, I've been paying attention!
<string>......
<string>Nice work down there. I'm so glad you're safe!<lf>Even Olivia and Werner... Ugh, those idiots!
<string>I seriously thought Astrum Unit was going to<lf>burn up like a shooting star. Bad joke, but apt.
<string>Erik, if you don't mind me asking,<lf>why the "Astrum" in Astrum Unit?
<string>Are you familiar with the Research Commission that crossed to<lf>the New World? The First Fleet had a star for its emblem.
<string>And Olivia and I both admire their courage.
<string>Is that what you hope to do one day?<lf>Travel to the New World?
<string>Mm, not especially. I don't think Olivia does either.
<string>They risked their lives for something that didn't exist<lf>in this world. It's almost...madness, if you ask me.
<string>For better or worse, Olivia and I cherish the people<lf>in our lives too much to go on that wild an adventure.
<string>Still, Olivia has more in common with the First Fleet<lf>than I think she realizes...
<string>Because she's chasing after something this world<lf>can't ever give her—
<string>A-And that's enough out of Erik! I'd like to hear<lf>more about you, if you feel like sharing.
<string>Yeah. Maybe one day.
<string>Athos, I see your wounds from Gogmazios<lf>are bothering you less.
<string>What, these? Heh. I'm more concerned<lf>about Werner's injuries.
<string>But...if we're being honest, I did think that might<lf>be the end. Nadia's the only reason it wasn't.
<string>Either way, I am not afraid with Livvie at my side.
<string>Then you intend to follow her wherever<lf>her path takes her?
<string>Follow her?
<string>No no, Avis Hunter. I do not "follow."<lf>Livvie has no sway over how I spend my life.
<string>I go where I wish to go. All I said is,<lf>"where she dies, I die as well."
<string>That's a stark fate.
<string>We all meet our end, though, do we not?<lf>I, for one, feel blessed to be able to choose mine.
<string>When the inevitable day does come for me,<lf>promise you'll be watching from afar...
<string>And that you'll smile.
<string>Oh, well hello there.
<string>So you're the one... I was wondering when we'd<lf>have a chance to talk.
<string>That Gogmazios hunt was something.
<string>How do you and Gemma know each other?
<string>Mind if I float an idea?
<string>(End Conversation)
<string>You guys really busted your butts against that<lf>Gogmazios. I'm glad I made it in time.
<string>Yeah, about that...
<string>You said something to Werner.<lf>"Aren't you glad I showed up?"
<string>Curious as to why.
<string>Oh please. I bet he was saying, "Keep her away!"<lf>or "We don't need her." He did, right?
<string>I could hear it all the way back west.
<string>Not literally, of course. But that guy's so<lf>predictable that it's easy to picture him griping.
<string>Especially since he only knows, like, two<lf>different gripes. Wish he'd learn to vary it up.
<string>I hear that you and Gemma go way back.
<string>Little Miss? Yeah...way back.<lf>She's basically like a little sister.
<string>She studied under her master for a long time,<lf>traveling around and helping people.
<string>Eventually she parted ways with the Caravan<lf>and started scoring solo gigs with the Guild.
<string>It all feels just like yesterday.
<string>Mind if I float an idea?<lf>We should go on a hunt sometime.
<string>Oh, there's an idea! I'd like that.
<string>Say, why don't we invite Rosso along?<lf>More the merrier!
<string>Yeah...more the merrier.
<string>Don't worry. I promise I'll help out.
<string>...Occasionally.
<string>You keep looking after Gemma for me, OK?
<string>Hey, Avis Hunter.<lf>Quite a show you put on back there.
<string>That was some quick thinking you did—<lf>repurposing those pieces as slinger ammo? Huh!
<string>Once again, you amazed us.
<string>You fought tooth and nail yourself, no matter<lf>how grim things got.
<string>'Course I did!<lf>When people call on Rosso, Rosso delivers.
<string>And don't you ever forget it.
<string>Hey, did you get some rest?<lf>You looked pretty rough at the end of all that.
<string>Look who's talking. But, hey, we got it done.
<string>We? I'm just another hunter along for the ride.<lf>No way I could have pulled that off without you.
<string>For once, I wish they'd give me a quest to<lf>settle down somewhere and retire.
<string>Or if that's too big an ask, they could at least<lf>send me home for a while. I miss the cooking...
<string>Good to see you in one piece, Mina.
<string>Hey, you too, Hunter! That Gogmazios was<lf>a nightmare. Never seen anything like it.
<string>It was a grueling fight, and thankfully not<lf>our last. Hahaha!
<string>I realized that I'd better start bulking up<lf>if I want to be ready for any other surprises.
<string>And that means: MEAT.
<string>Kai, I can't thank you enough<lf>for your help back there.
<string>Oh, come on. Just doing what I'm supposed to.
<string>But that was one terrifying monster, wasn't it?
<string>Desi was our rep handling repairs, and it scares<lf>me that I almost didn't get him out of there.
<string>I'm glad Werner pulled through, too.
<string>I hope this earns us some peace and quiet,<lf>but if we need to team up again, I've got your back.
<string>Excellent work on the Gogmazios hunt.<lf>I'm so glad everyone is safe.
<string>I was able to fight my hardest knowing you were<lf>there ready to step in.
<string>That's nice of you to say. I am at my best when<lf>I act as someone's shield, someone's shadow.
<string>But never have I been so terrified<lf>to be called upon as such.
<string>Because that would signify the moment<lf>one of us had fallen...
<string>I shall savor the fact that such<lf>a grim moment never came!
<string>Hello, um..."Nightmist," I believe it was?
<string>Ah, yes. That is my current name, isn't it?<lf>I so easily forget.
<string>My role on this mission was to step in should<lf>anything befall Sharpeyes.
<string>I am glad this never happened.<lf>Many would have wept her loss.
<string>Anyway, now that this task is done, you may<lf>call on me in the future, and perhaps I will come.
<string>Farewell, Avis.
<string>Access Conversation
<string>All right. Let's go have a talk with him.
<string>The Palicoes are ready to assist in this matter<lf>in every capacity, starting with Azuz's defense.
<string>As for Werner... He knows what he's getting into.<lf>I'll keep my barbs to myself.
<string>Griffin will team up with you, Hunter.
<string>Good luck out there. I just know everyone<lf>will return home safely.
