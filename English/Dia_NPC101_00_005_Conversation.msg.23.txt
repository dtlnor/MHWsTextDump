<string>Nata has changed a lot after experiencing<lf>the outside world.
<string>A Keeper's way of life is set in stone...<lf>and yet these changes fill me with such joy.
<string>What you refer to as the "Plenty" coincides with<lf>a thinning of the Wyvern Milk's flow.
<string>We call this the Wyvern's Tranquility—<lf>a period of relative safety.
<string>All I wanted was for Nata to escape...<lf>It was the only thought in my mind.
<string>And now I can say with pride that I made<lf>the right choice.
<string>I cannot thank you enough for all you've done.
<string>Nata's father was an old friend of mine.<lf>He passed quite some time ago.
<string>The man always had a far-off look about him.<lf>Maybe that's why he was trusted with the pendant.
<string>Or maybe he was like that <ITALIC>because</ITALIC> he was trusted<lf>with it.
<string>He was a good man.
<string>Please take care of Nata.
<string>...And Arkveld as well.
<string>Good Hunter, the Keepers stand ready to guard<lf>history's secrets. We have accepted that burden.
<string>Is that not why we were put here?<lf>Our reason for being?
<string>To be enshrined here forever alongside Wyveria and<lf>the Guardians, and all the mistakes of the past?
<string>Nata has started to take after his father.
<string>Good Hunter... Do you think we Keepers would<lf>be forgiven for choosing a new way of life?
<string>That is, if we are even capable of change...
<string>How is Nata? He must be learning a great deal<lf>from you.
<string>The Dragontorch, our symbol of permanence—and all<lf>these years it has been changing unbeknownst to us.
<string>Will we be able to do the same?
<string>Good Hunter... Do you think we Keepers would<lf>be forgiven for choosing a new way of life?
<string>That is, if we are even capable of change...
<string>Nata has started to take after his father.
