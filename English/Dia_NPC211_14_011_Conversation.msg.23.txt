<string>Well met, Hunter.
<string>The Auscaltary is a place of great importance to us.
<string>When I am here, my thoughts weigh heavy—
<string>Life and death, earth and sky...<lf>It all exists within the same continuance.
<string>I am pleased to meet you, Hunter. I have awaited<lf>you here alongside the Allhearken.
<string>In this place, I have heard a great<lf>many tales from the Allhearken.
<string>Always, I am left to reflect that life and death,<lf>earth and sky exist upon the same field of time.
<string>All of your actions, too, exist upon the same<lf>field of time.
<string>We've seen more visitors here as of late. The<lf>sight of it reminds me...
<string>...of the age of lost Wyveria, when many traveled<lf>to beg the Allhearken's counsel.
<string>All of your actions, too, exist upon the same<lf>field of time.
<string>Whatever comes, it shall also exist upon the same<lf>field of time.
<string>Whatever comes, it shall also exist upon the same<lf>field of time.
<string>Whatever comes, it shall also exist upon the same<lf>field of time.
<string>Well met, Hunter. Yours has become quite the<lf>familiar face.
<string>At times, I wonder how far my life will lead.<lf>How long I will enjoy this fair view.
<string>We've seen more visitors here as of late. The<lf>sight of it reminds me...
<string>of the age of lost Wyveria, when many traveled<lf>to beg the Allhearken's counsel.
