<string>The Sandtide always comes after the Fallow.<lf>There's a lot to prepare for its arrival.
<string>Sorry if everyone is a bit more curt than usual.<lf>We're all pretty busy right now.
<string>When the Sandtide comes, our gemchimes go<lf>flying. Along with a bunch of other things.
<string>It feels like we're always repairing something or<lf>other, but I love that sort of work.
<string>Could really go for some cheese right now...
<string>Ah, sorry. Just getting a bit hungry.
<string>Sometimes our stores run low, and we have<lf>to cut back on our food intake.
<string>Sometimes we lose lives to the Sandtide.
<string>My grandmother and the Elder say it's part<lf>of life in the desert. But...
<string>It still hurts every time.
<string>During the season of Plenty we all go out to forage.
<string>Plants, flowers, fruits, water... Sometimes it's<lf>so beautiful I tear up a bit!
<string>A bit silly, right? Crying over nature.
<string>It's important that we really fatten up our<lf>livestock during the Season of Plenty.
<string>They can tell when we're slacking off, you know.<lf>Seikret get reeeal nippy.
<string>You're quite good with a Seikret,<lf><PLNAME>.
<string>They can read their rider's mood. Real sensitive<lf>creatures.
<string>I'll bet your Seikret performs so well because<lf>of your bravery and confidence.
<string>If I may, I'd like to tell you about Nona for a bit,<lf><PLNAME>.
<string>She's still young, but she's a natural with<lf>Seikret. Very smart, too.
<string>She's going to be the one holding our village<lf>together in the future, I just know it.
