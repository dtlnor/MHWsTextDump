<string>The Sandtide always comes after the Fallow.<lf>There's a lot to prepare for its arrival.
<string>Sorry if everyone is a bit more curt than usual.<lf>We're all pretty busy right now.
<string>When the Sandtide comes, our gemchimes go<lf>flying. Along with a bunch of other things.
<string>It feels like we're always repairing something or<lf>other, but I love that sort of work.
<string>Could really go for some cheese right now...
<string>Ah, sorry. Just getting a bit hungry.
<string>Sometimes our stores run low, and we have<lf>to cut back on our food intake.
<string>Sometimes we lose lives to the Sandtide.
<string>My grandmother and the Elder say it's part<lf>of life in the desert. But...
<string>It still hurts every time.
<string>You're sure able to do a lot with that weapon<lf>of yours.
<string>It's something we never considered here.
<string>During the season of Plenty we all go out to forage.
<string>Plants, flowers, fruits, water... Sometimes it's<lf>so beautiful I tear up a bit!
<string>A bit silly, right? Crying over nature.
<string>It's important that we really fatten up our<lf>livestock during the season of Plenty.
<string>They can tell when we're slacking off, you know.<lf>Seikret get reeeal nippy.
<string>You're quite good with a Seikret,<lf><PLNAME>.
<string>They can read their rider's mood. Real sensitive<lf>creatures.
<string>I'll bet your Seikret performs so well because<lf>of your bravery and confidence.
<string>If I may, I'd like to tell you about Nona for a bit,<lf><PLNAME>.
<string>She's still young, but she's a natural with<lf>Seikret. Very smart, too.
<string>She's going to be the one holding our village<lf>together in the future, I just know it.
<string>I've never been outside the Windward Plains<lf>myself.
<string>But I can tell that you all are traveling for<lf>something important.
<string>I don't know how much help I'll be, but I'll<lf>do my best to do what I can for you!
<string>Are you going to the forest? I've never been<lf>there, actually.
<string>All those big trees blocking out the wind and sky...<lf>Just the thought of it makes me anxious.
<string>You all be careful!
<string>I'm glad we could properly thank you.<lf>It's been a while since we had guests.
<string>My grandmother looked so happy...<lf>Truly, thank you for joining us.
<string>I'll go ahead to talk to the Elder!
<string>I'm...I'm so glad you all got back safely!
<string>Sorry to have worried you.
<string>It's fine! Anyway, it's time for us to put the<lf>village back together. Time to pull it together!
<string>I'm as lost as anyone about all this.
<string>My grandmother did mention that the weather's<lf>been changing slowly over the last few decades.
<string><PLNAME>! Go see Nona, if you<lf>have the time.
<string>She's started a new project I think will surprise<lf>you. I promise it'll be worth your time!
<string>What's got into them...? The Seikret have been<lf>really restless lately.
<string>Has their food gone off?<lf>Maybe the water is stale...
<string>I thought that a Vanguard's job was next<lf>to impossible.
<string>But after helping Zatoh earlier, I learned that<lf>maybe it's not so bad after all.
<string>Well, I say this. But even if I can do each action<lf>by itself, putting it all together is a lot harder.
<string>Zatoh has been asking me to help with various<lf>odd jobs lately.
<string>You don't think he wants me for the Vanguard...?<lf>Haha, could you imagine?
<string>I can, actually.
<string>When I stop to think about it, I'm awfully lucky.<lf>I'm still alive, for one, and my family is safe.
<string>I really owe you for helping us. Thanks for being<lf>my family's good luck charm!

<string>Ah, <PLNAME>! Nona was just chased by an<lf>unknown monster!
<string>Or wait... Was it that she was doing the chasing?
<string>Either way, my heart skipped a beat!
