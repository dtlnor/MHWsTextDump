<string>Oh, hello there.
<string>Here to look at the quests?
<string>How can I help?
<string>An urgent quest needs your attention.
<string>This quest is of great importance.
<string>I have an important quest for you.
<string>This quest is more like a <ITALIC>re-</ITALIC>quest.
<string>You've been specifically requested for this quest.
<string>Now that's a face that looks ready to go!
<string>I knew you'd stop by.
<string>So...here to look at the quests?
<string>Do you want to cancel the quest in progress?
<string>Should I cancel your quest?
<string>We're off, then!
<string>Our first priority is to return safely.
<string>Do you have everything you need?
<string>I have full faith in our abilities.
<string>As long as we are careful, we shouldn't have any troubles.
<string>You can rely on me!
<string>Until next time, then.
<string>Are you still preparing? Take your time.
<string>I'm ready whenever you are.
<string>Hm? Did you forget something?
<string>Fair enough. I'll be here!
<string>Hmm, what to investigate next...? Any ideas?
<string>That's definitely my next research subject— Ooh, although...
<string>Let's do this again soon, hmm?
