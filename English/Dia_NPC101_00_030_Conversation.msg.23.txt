<string>Sup.
<string>Hey, what's your favorite color?<lf>Mine's gotta be...red!
<string>Me, I'll go wherever I'm called. As long as it puts<lf>steak on the table, I'll never turn down a job!
<string>I'm Rosso. Rubrum Unit. Oh, guess we covered that<lf>back at the initial briefing.
<string>Any trouble pops up, I'll come running, friend.<lf>We gotta have each other's backs.
<string>You sure that was your first time riding that bird<lf>wyvern? Sure didn't look like it.
<string>A rowdy Seikret for a rowdy hunter, eh? You two<lf>make a pretty good pair.
<string>No matter where you go, the endless stream<lf>of problems and requests doesn't change, huh.
<string>Huh... Pretty wild. How come the weather changes<lf>like the flip of a switch, d'you think?
<string>The village folk mention anything about it?
<string>Is that Landspine thing really something we should<lf>be poking at?
<string>Call me boring, but I'm not about whacking<lf>a beehive with a stick, y'know what I mean?
<string>That being said...I was the one who decided to go<lf>to a place known as the "Forbidden Lands," huh!
<string>Awright, it's really starting to come together.<lf>Gah, I live for these moments.
<string>But why'd the White Wraith take a pass on the<lf>Firespring? Too full for seconds?
<string>Eh, but that can wait. You've gotta go grab Nata.<lf>Don't keep him waiting.
<string>Who's really to say what the right answer is?
<string>I say pick what feels right and stick to your<lf>bowguns. Know what I mean?
<string>Nice hustle, Avis Unit.
<string>Looks like neither of us are going<lf>home anytime soon.
<string>Yep.
<string>Hey, uh. Should we really have just left the<lf>Dragontorch like that?
<string>Guess there aren't really any right answers.<lf>Just gotta muddle our way through, right?
<string>Guess the Dragontorch really is going crazy, huh.
<string>Nata's looking a lot better these days. Far as<lf>I'm concerned, that's enough.
<string>Seeing all those worried wrinkles melt into<lf>a smile makes the whole thing worth it, yeah?
<string>Looks like neither of us are going<lf>home anytime soon.
<string>Yep.
<string>What's the plan, buddy? You here till the grave?
