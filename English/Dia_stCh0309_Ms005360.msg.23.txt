<string>Do you really think Arkveld is just like<lf>any other monster now?
<string>Not sure. It's too soon to say.
<string>But that's why we're going—to find out.
<string>Come on, Nata. Let's go finish what we started.
<string>Right.
<string>To the lower stratum!
<string>Hunter, I've been thinking a lot about<lf>the Keepers and the Guardians.
<string>The Wyvern Milk kept the Guardians asleep<lf>in their cocoons, chained up.
<string>But the Keepers have been chained, too.
<string>By the duty we've upheld for a thousand years.
<string>Then Arkveld came and broke it all apart.
<string>But it freed itself, with its own strength.<lf>It even learned to eat.
<string>It didn't care how it was created.<lf>It just wanted to be free. To live.
<string>This journey has made me something more.
<string>I've seen vast sands, lush forests. People. Life.
<string>Arkveld and I are the same.
<string>It broke the chains that were holding me<lf>and my people back.
<string>I'm sure of it.
<string>Anyone else's fur getting that funny feeling?
<string>Uh...
<string>What is this?
<string>I think it's...blood.
<string>Arkveld's lost control—it's gone berserk!<lf>Don't let your guard down!
<string>Mew got it!
<string>We do what we're able to when the time comes.<lf>Gotta trust your heart to steer you right.
<string>Issuing the slay request...for the Guardian Arkveld.
<string>What was the White Wraith after, in the end? The answer is<lf>out of our reach, now... All we're left with is regret.
<string>For a moment, I...lost track of myself. I was back<lf>in those days of idly staring out of the window.
<string>Why, I wonder...
<string>Hunter...
<string>I'm...
<string>...
<string>Our only path forward is to put a stop to Arkveld...<lf>the White Wraith.
<string>As a hunter, I'll do what has to be done.
<string>I know you will.
<string>Arkveld seems to use dragon element attacks<lf>in addition to its Guardian energy.
<string>Dragon resistance may go a long way.
<string>What? The Dragontorch...taken over by—?
<string>Whatever that thing possessing it was,<lf>it looked ready to awaken at any moment.
<string>What is it?
<string>It is Zoh Shia. Wyveria created it<lf>as their final line of defense.
<string>This is the very Guardian that doomed the capital.
<string>We thought it fell dormant... but if it's been drawing<lf>energy directly from the Dragontorch the whole time—
<string>We can't leave it unchecked.<lf>Surely there's some way to deal with it?
<string>Without exception, a Guardian cut off from<lf>its energy supply will die.
<string>If we put a stop to the Dragontorch,<lf>Zoh Shia will perish, too.
<string>But the entire Eastlands are sustained by the energy<lf>from the Dragontorch. If we stop it...
<string>It would affect all life in this region<lf>as we know it.
<string>Tell me how we can stop the Dragontorch.
<string>Nata's pendant.
<string>As part of our deep knowledge of this energy,<lf>we possess a substance to counteract it.
<string>Nata's pendant is an extremely concentrated<lf>mass of that countervailing power.
<string>It was his father's role to stop the Dragontorch<lf>in a time of crisis.
