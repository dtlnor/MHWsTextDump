<string>Alright. This is it.

<string>This must be part of the Landspine...<lf>Or, was it the Wyrmway?
<string>It's like a big tree. I've never seen a place like this.
<string>We know the Wyrmway carries the Dragontorch's<lf>energy, so if it's converging here like this...
<string>The Dragontorch must be deep below us?
<string>Seems like a good theory.
<string>These must be those roots he told us to follow up.
<string>We should set up camp before continuing.
<string>Right, let's get ourselves set up.
<string>There. Perfect.
<string>Now, everyone, we will begin our survey of the<lf>Guardians here in Wyveria's middle stratum.
<string>Our ultimate objective is to determine where in the<lf>lower stratum Arkveld might have gone, and why.
<string>OK. So where do we begin?
<string>We'll start by looking for spoor. Arkveld's<lf>or any Guardian's we can find.
<string>Good plan. Let's get started, then.

<string>I'll stay here and hold down the fort. Come right<lf>back if you need anything.
<string>OK, everyone mount up!
<string>There's no telling what will happen. We want to<lf>be sure we're prepared.
<string>I'm coming with you. I want to see<lf>what you do, Hunter.
<string>An Ebony Odogaron! It really is a Guardian!
<string>Not exactly calling this a lucky break, but hey.<lf>It's your time to shine, Hunter! You got this.
<string>Odogaron and its Ebony counterpart are both<lf>extremely territorial monsters.
<string>The people of Wyveria surely understood that well,<lf>and fostered that tendency for their own purposes.
<string>Considering the Ebony Odogaron's nature, I doubt<lf>there's any path forward for us while it's alive.
<string>Especially as a Guardian deliberately tasked with<lf>security. Consider this a formal slaying request.
<string>I didn't see that track as anything other than<lf>just "some stuff on the ground."
<string>Are all hunters able to see things the way you do?
<string>If there are security Guardians here, do you think<lf>that means there's something important below?
<string>Ordinary Ebony Odogaron use dragon-element attacks,<lf>so it stands to reason this Guardian will, too.
<string>Did you remember to bring nulberries?
<string>Guardians discharge energy through those parts<lf>with the pale stripes.
<string>We can expect the same from this Odogaron.<lf>If you see a part flash, watch out.
