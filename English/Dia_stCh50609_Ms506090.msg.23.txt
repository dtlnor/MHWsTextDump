<string>Hail, Hunter. As two passengers on fate's current,<lf>I'll not presume to say I awaited you, but well met.
<string>Know you of a beastly bird, red of hue and flame?<lf>I was given rare cause to flee on all four limbs.
<string>The one possibility that leaps to mind is a Yian Kut-Ku.<lf>They're not native to this climate, though.
<string>This one seemed the aberrant sort, though it's nary my<lf>place to judge after trading my forest for ruins.
<string>Was there anything else you noticed?<lf>Anything that stuck out to you?
<string>...An ominous carriage. A bloodthirst fit to boil.<lf>The fiend nigh devoured me, pointy topper and all.
<string>I think I understand? Probably. I suppose<lf>it'll serve as a clue, at least...probably.
<string>Selfish though it be, I'm not yet fain to part<lf>with life and limb. Too many ruins yet await me.
<string>In any case, it seems unlikely this is a normal<lf>monster. Do you mind leaving this to us?
<string>What qualm might I bear the inevitable? I shall<lf>bide here, in gratitude for your noble spirit.
<string>I see... If it was a Yian Kut-Ku,<lf>that raises a few different concerns.
<string>The habitat is wrong, for one, and it's not a<lf>species known for the viciousness Rove described.
<string>I think this clearly merits investigation. We need<lf>to ensure Rove and the Base Camp's safety.
<string>I went ahead and took the liberty of registering<lf>a new quest. Best of luck.
<string>Hold on, that's clearly Frenzy!<lf>It's spread this far...?
<string>Priorities. We need to deal with it.<lf>Hunt authorized!
<string>Understood!
<string>The monster you reported has been taken care<lf>of. It was too dangerous to let roam.
<string>Please let us know if you come across anything<lf>similar again. We'd like to find the root cause.
<string>Be assured. Though we may differ in fur and fancy,<lf>we are seekers both. Companions at the fireside.
<string>You are a wanderer of these lands. As a stranger-<lf>turned-denizen of this place, we are kin in that.
<string>And so affection blooms between us. In time, I'll<lf>surely take to wandering anew, to seek more ruins.
<string>That urge is a familiar one. There's still a lot<lf>of world left out there.
<string>Then let me keep you from it no longer. Take this,<lf>my fellow rambler. A humble thanks.
