<string>When I see you, I'm made to feel the difference<lf>between hearing and seeing with one's eyes.
<string>Ahh, if only I could see more with these eyes.<lf>To feel more with these hands!
<string>When feeling lost, simply ask for guidance from<lf>within. I do so frequently, myself.
<string>Whoa, a bird! Oh, don't startle me so...
<string>Goodness. Someone actually came...
<string>Quite the surprise, mm? Not that it fazes me,<lf>but it's surprising all the same.
<string>The Allhearken hears all manner of things.<lf>I recommend you do the same.
<string>Search within to learn what you ought to do.
<string>What you saw is history itself. Time that is now<lf>beyond the reach of any and all.
<string>How was it? What did you feel as you saw it?
<string>Ahh, if only I could also see more. To feel more<lf>with these hands!
<string>How did Wounded Hollow seem to you?
<string>How has everything been?
<string>How has everything been?
<string>I always thought that no matter how far, anywhere<lf>the ground reached was just a short distance...
<string>It's true, yes, but it also really isn't.<lf>*sigh*...
<string>My inward meditation has left me with a feeling<lf>of wanderlust, an urge to broaden my horizons.
<string>The question is whether I take the leap...
<string>Have you ever traveled afar, only to realize that<lf>what was closest to you was also the dearest?
<string>What sort of place is your homeland? It must be<lf>wonderful, no?
<string>The Keepers have some unusual things. It was<lf>always fun to see what they offered.
<string>Your possessions are quite interesting, too.
