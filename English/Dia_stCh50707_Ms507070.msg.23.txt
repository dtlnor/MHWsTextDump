<string>Oh, it's you... Something terrible has happened.<lf>Will you listen a moment?
<string>What's wrong?
<string>One of our number, Soshi, is missing. And the<lf>one witness's account is a bit unbelievable.
<string>They claim he was taken by Xu Wu.
<string>And from the midst of our village, no less.
<string>A villager, carried off by a monster? Has that<lf>happened here before?
<string>Never. Perhaps by a Guardian, outside, but for one<lf>to enter the village is entirely unheard of.
<string>We'll take up the investigation from here. Please<lf>see that everyone stays alert while we look into it.
<string>Thank you, and my apologies, but I fear this is a<lf>matter beyond our hands... Good luck.
<string>I received report of Xu Wu attacking the village<lf>as well. It seems an unprecedented incident...
<string>We've prepped the scoutflies with traces left<lf>in the village and some of Soshi's possessions.
<string>Alright. When I'm ready, we'll head out.<lf>We need to respond to the situation swiftly.
<string>Agreed. We can't allow the village to come to any<lf>further harm. To say nothing of the missing man...
<string>Right. We can only pray that he's still safe.
<string>...I heard about Soshi. That all that remained of<lf>him was a ragged scrap of cloth.
<string>I'm sorry. It may come as cold comfort, but I<lf>believe he left an important discovery behind.
<string>And what is that?
<string>We may have discovered an issue regarding the<lf>fibers you use to make your clothing.
<string>It's just a theory, but its Guardian-deterring traits<lf>may have the opposite effect on their predator.
<string>Wait, you don't think—it mistook us for Guardians<lf>because of our clothes? But, surely that can't...!
<string>I believe it's possible. Especially as a moving<lf>object.
<string>Then...the threat we ought to be watching most<lf>closely for is Xu Wu, not the Guardians.
<string>Thank you, for bringing this to my attention.<lf>I hope you'll allow us to assist you, in return.
<string>There's little we can offer, save the materials we<lf>gather... Speak to the others here, if you wish.
<string>We'd welcome the help. But please...direct your<lf>thanks to him.
<string>Yes... We just finished laying his grave. I will<lf>visit and have a long chat with him later.
<string>It seems Xu Wu is clearly targeting Guardians...
<string>Right. But why snatch a human villager?
<string>It's headed to its nest.<lf>We should follow!
<string>We haven't found any sign of Soshi yet, but surely<lf>in the monster's nest...!
<string>Hey, I think I saw something that looked like<lf>a scrap of clothing earlier.
<string>Really? The Keepers' clothing was made to imitate<lf>the cocoons, right?
<string>Right. The Guardians are less likely to see them<lf>as a threat, and it camouflages their village, too.
<string>I see. Let's go report back.<lf>We have to tell them what we learned.
<string>There it is! <lf>But I don't see any sign of Soshi...
<string>Yeah... But we need to think of the<lf>village first. It might attack again.
<string>Right! The Guild authorizes this hunt to ensure the<lf>safety of the village and locate the missing person!
<string>Understood!
<string>Allow me to accompany you on this investigation.<lf>Let's start by finding the Xu Wu that took Soshi.
