<string>Are you getting enough support, Hunter?
<string>Salutations, Hunter. I trust your investigation<lf>is going smoothly?
<string>Worry not, we are maintaining an appropriate<lf>distance from the Keepers.
<string>A pleasure to meet you, Hunter. I oversee the<lf>Support Team here.
<string>I have been thoroughly briefed on the appropriate<lf>distance to maintain with the Keepers. Worry not.
<string>There don't appear to be any Lynians in this<lf>village... Perhaps I oughtn't wander about too much?
<string>Word of the White Wraith's coming is apt to cause<lf>a panic here. It would only invite further tragedy.
<string>We must act quickly and decisively.
<string>I am relieved to see you safe... Doubly so, that<lf>Nata and Tasheen also appear unharmed.
<string>So you'll be investigating within Wyveria.<lf>I'm certain your skills will shine there.
<string>It's been far too long, Hunter.<lf>Lovely to see you looking well.
<string>Are the members of Astrum Unit in good health as well?
<string>If your hunter's instincts tell you that something<lf>is amiss in all the regions, it must surely be so.
<string>This is another fine feather in your cap, Hunter.
<string>I quietly pray that the day will come when Nata...<lf>When all the Keepers choose their own path freely.
<string>Just what was it the Guardian Arkveld really<lf>destroyed, I wonder...
