<string>You look busy as always, Hunter.
<string>What is it?

<string>Any word from the people?
<string>(End Conversation)
<string>How have things been lately?
<string>I heard from the others.
<string>I was given a message for you.
<string>OK, bye.
<string>Goodbye.
<string>Somebody wants to make a trade.
<string>Would you like to trade something?
<string>I can help you source materials.
<string>Everyone in the village said they can help, too.
<string>They said this was our share from the<lf>Firespring Festival.
<string>The people from Azuz told me to tell you they said hello.
<string>Hunter, I've got something here from my village,<lf>and I'd like you to have it.
<string>Uncle Tasheen told me he was grateful to you for<lf>breaking the chains that bind us.
<string>I'm sure there's more to it than I'm understanding,<lf>but I feel the same way.
<string>So please, take this as a thank you.
<string>Hunter, take a look at what I made.<lf>Gemma helped me.
<string>I'm not saying we're the same thing—<lf>Arkveld is Arkveld, and I'm me—
<string>but you helped me realize we're the same <ITALIC>kind</ITALIC><lf>of thing, and I'm truly grateful for it.
<string>Would you accept this as my way of saying thanks?
<string>Hunter, I've thought about it, and we need a place<lf>where Eastlanders and Westlanders can connect. 
<string>I talked to the Guild people about it, and we<lf>agreed that I could be a kind of...liaison, is it?
<string>Like, a person to go from village to village,<lf>gather information, relay it back and forth.
<string>I'm really serious about this, so if you have any<lf>messages for the Eastlanders, let me know, OK?
<string>I've got a lot of stuff here from everyone.
