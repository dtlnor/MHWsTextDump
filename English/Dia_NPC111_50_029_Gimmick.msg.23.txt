<string>The Convergent Elderbreaker fell off it.
<string>Connect the nexus to the Convergent Elderbreaker!
<string>Attach that to the Convergent Elderbreaker!
<string>If you attach that to it, the Convergent Elderbreaker<lf>should be able to charge up energy!
<string>Look out!
<string>Be careful!
<string>It's going to attack!
<string>It's focusing on you!
<string>You need to distract it!
<string>Good. It's connected.
<string>That's it. Get it good and charged.
<string>Good. But try not to go overboard.<lf>There's no point if you die in the process.
<string>It's charged to maximum capacity!
<string>The Elderbreaker has charged enough!
<string>You need to charge the Convergent Elderbreaker!
<string>It's not charged at all...
<string>Did you hear me? You have to charge it!
<string>It still needs more charge.
<string>Try to get it fully charged!
<string>Hey, you can still charge it!
<string>It's at maximum capacity! I'll leave the timing to you!
<string>Hey, it's sufficiently charged!
<string>It's fully charged! Let her rip already!
<string>It's losing energy! Check the connection!
<string>It lost energy... Is something wrong?
<string>Hey, it's losing energy.
<string>Well... Now that is something.
<string>Hmm... The conversion rate's not quite what I expected.
<string>Hmm, that was OK, I guess.
<string>Bet it could do even more damage than that.
<string>Nothing to fret over. Just try again.
<string>That was so close. Well, there's always next time.
<string>Guess my work here is done.
<string>I did what I could.
<string>You all better come back alive.
<string>Gotta live to see another day... Time to go.
<string>Well, I'm outta here.
<string>Hm? Lava pools...?
<string>Hm? Did that just burst...?
<string>Lava just burst out.
<string>Hit it with the lava!
<string>That'll do some good damage if you<lf>hit the monster with it.
<string>That's some powerful coal.
<string>Hey hunters, there's some good stuff over there!
<string>That stuff's powerful! Don't get caught in the blast!
<string>Oh? Can you hit it?
<string>Coal, huh? Good choice.
<string>There's an artifact right there that looks exactly like<lf>what we need.
<string>Can you see the switch on there?<lf>Use it when the moment's right. You'll only get one shot!
<string>What's that artifact? Almost looks like a Dragonator.
<string>Look for the switch! And wait for the right moment!<lf>You'll only get one shot!
<string>You're a deft hand with that.
<string>A simple piercing beam is always a surefire method...
<string>In the end, even the Specter of War still bleeds.
<string>If we had that back then... Things would've been<lf>a whole lot simpler.
<string>Consider it a blessing that it worked at all.
<string>Just think of how to do better next time.
<string>I'd say that worked pretty well.
<string>I'd like to say it was simply part of the plan,<lf>but I have to give credit to your skill here.
<string>Expertly handled.
