<string>Our destination is Rimechain Peak.<lf>Talk to Omega when you're ready.
<string>*blip* Are you ready to depart?
<string>I'm ready. Let's go!
<string>Give me just a little more time.
<string>Understood. Alma, your navigational assistance<lf>is requested.
<string>While this chassis is somewhat resistant to cold,<lf>I do recommend you expedite this matter.
<string>Oh! I'd better go get Alma for this. If you<lf>need me, I'll be at the Forest Base Camp.
<string>Target identified: Beta-class lifeform, structurally weak.<lf>No further analysis required. Commencing termination.
<string>If this is what it takes to keep everyone safe...!
<string>What kind of ammo works on this?<lf>Does ANY ammo work on this?
<string>I'm dreaming. This has to be a dream.
<string>I'll have a good story to tell after this!
<string>What is this thing!?
<string>Now this right here makes me<lf>want to go straight back to bed.
<string>Oh... This is interesting.
<string>Reconfiguring. Deploying combat modules.
<string>Pantokrator mode engaged. Re-routing<lf>navigational resources to weapons systems...
<string>Pantokrator mode re-engaged.<lf>Freeing reserve cylinders. Attack, attack, attack.
<string>Possibility of defeat detected... Incogitable conclusion.<lf>Eliminate! Eliminate!
<string><COLOR FF0000>#Rejected#</COLOR> Dia_stCh7301_Ms730020_080_t001
<string>That was the “Let 'em rip” mode. *blip*<lf>A satisfactory interpretation, wouldn't you agree?
<string>Surviving this won't be easy.<lf>Damaging the legs may neutralize the attack.
<string>Severe leg damage incurred.<lf>Halting Pantokrator mode.
<string>Yesss!
<string>Anomaly detected in shield generation system.<lf>Deployment coordinates unstable.
<string>Recommendation: Make use of that shield.<lf>It should help you avoid incoming attacks.
<string>If someone draws its attention,<lf>we're certain to find an opening!
<string>Acquiring new target.<lf>Target acquired—locking on.
<string>Warning: Hunter vital signs deteriorating.
<string>Compounded infliction of penalties reduces maximum health.<lf>Administer optimal remedy immediately.
<string>Penalty detected on ally.<lf>Their maximum health is reduced.
<string>Penalties increase probability of mission failure.<lf>Suggestion: Distract enemy or assist ally.
<string>Damage threshold reached. Delta Attack authorized.<lf>Generating guard units...
<string>Initiating Delta Attack sequence.<lf>Charging...
<string>That attack will wipe out the entire area.<lf>You must act before it finishes charging.
<string>I suggest that you slay the Nerscylla that was<lf>generated. It might work like the shield before.
<string>Charge at 50%—initiating second sequence.
<string>*blip* I advise you to slay the Nerscylla<lf>as swiftly as possible.
<string>Suggestion: Prioritize expedient slaying of the Nerscylla!
<string>Charge at 80%—initiating final sequence.<lf>Charge efficiency increasing.
<string>Nerscylla down—high-density energy detected.<lf>You can use it as a shield!
<string>Enter the high-density energy! Immediately!
<string>Charge at 100%. Target locked. Safety removed.<lf>Power output maximum. Firing Delta Attack.
<string>Target survival...confirmed.<lf>Unexpected result. Recalculating......
<string>…Recalculations complete.<lf>Resuming elimination of hostile lifeform.
<string>Reanalyzing. Lifeform exceeds beta-class<lf>power levels. Expanding accessible armaments.
<string>Times like these, you just gotta give up<lf>and throw what you know out the window.
<string><COLOR FF0000>#Rejected#</COLOR> Dia_stCh7301_Ms730020_350_t002
<string>We need to cast aside all our preconceptions.<lf>Have you reviewed your items?
<string><COLOR FF0000>#Rejected#</COLOR> Dia_stCh7301_Ms730020_360_t002
<string>Alma told me everything. I'm the same as usual.
<string>And it looks like...you are too.
<string>Kweh! Kweh kweh!?
<string><LSNR {He}{She}> will be all right, Alpha.<lf>The Hunter has sustained no severe trauma.
<string>The Omega frame has an arsenal of ranged weapons.<lf>You must anticipate their trajectory and act accordingly.
<string>Kweh, kweh kweh!<lf>Kweh kweh, kweh!
<string>Summarizing Alpha's remarks: "Good luck. Too bad<lf>I can't fight, or I would take it out in one hit."
<string>Kweh!?
<string>*blip* Hunter vitals confirmed. For a human,<lf>you are remarkably resilient.
<string>To stand against the Omega frame, cooperation—no,<lf>precise coordination among allies—is essential.
<string>I have observed firsthand how a synergistic,<lf>united effort can elicit immense strength.
<string>Welcome back. That was spectacular beyond words!
<string>*blip* This region's ecosystem should soon return<lf>to its original state.
<string>Kweh kweh!
<string><PLNAME>.<lf>I hold your combat abilities in high regard.
<string>Had my frame possessed more advanced observational<lf>functions, I could have provided a detailed assessment.
<string>You don't regret slaying a compatriot?
<string>...Recall what I said earlier.
<string>My homeland invested energy in the conquest<lf>of other planets...in the past.
<string>But now, no one presides over that project.<lf>No one awaits its fruition.
<string>For a weapon to continue fighting with no mission<lf>and no home to return to... This is illogical.
<string>Having seen these events through,<lf>Alpha and I will now return whence we came.
<string>A final warning. Omega Planetes arrived in this<lf>world via an irregularity.
<string>Such means of travel create warps in spacetime<lf>that can lead to the recurrence of past events.
<string>In other words, Omega Planetes may "again"<lf>arrive in your world for the first time.
<string>I recommend abundant caution, although I doubt<lf>one as strong as you has much to fear.
<string>Thank you for agreeing to help us so soon<lf>after your long and tiring journey here.
<string>We couldn't have averted this crisis without you,<lf>a fact the Hunters Guild won't soon forget.
<string>May our paths cross again one day.
<string>Kweh, kweh!
<string>Farewell, fierce hunters from beyond the rift.
<string>Farewell. And thank you again.
<string>A Jin Dahaad carcass...
<string>Omega Planetes has returned... And it may have<lf>assimilated Jin Dahaad's power. Be careful.
<string>A Jin Dahaad carcass...
<string>Which means that weapon has augmented itself using<lf>this region's apex. It will be far more powerful...
