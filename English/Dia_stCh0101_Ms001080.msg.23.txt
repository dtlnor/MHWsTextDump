<string>C'mon, let's go!
<string>So, I heard Astrum Unit set out to the forest<lf>ahead of us to set up a camp?
<string>Yeah, I heard the same.
<string>These guys seem like they're always<lf>one step ahead.
<string>So, whatcha think the forest is gonna be like?
<string>Full of diverse monsters.
<string>Wet and teeming with wildlife.
<string>Certainly it'll be a lot greener and<lf>more lush than the desert.
<string>We should see lots of herbivores—and where<lf>there's herbivores, there's what eats them.
<string>Pointing at you, Doshaguma.
<string>If there are people living in a place like that,<lf>I wonder what their way of life is like.
<string>Once we're there, I hope I can help you<lf>more with the expedition.
<string>The river coming from the forest feeds into the desert,<lf>so there must be plenty of water.
<string>If so, it's thriving with fish, insects, fungi...<lf>We might even encounter some leviathans.
<string>I really hope we don't see any of those...
<string>Once we're there, I hope I can help you<lf>more with the expedition.
<string>Hey, there it is!
<string>Wow, I think there ARE trees coming out of the trees!
<string>Hehe.
<string>Come on.
<string>So how'd your visit to that village go?
<string>We were able to start a dialogue. No luck with the Keepers,<lf>but I'm more concerned about something else now.
<string>Monsters called the Doshaguma have left their forest<lf>habitat and started venturing near the village.
<string>The village's only protection are these things called<lf>gemchimes. Which they seem to think is enough, but...

<string>What if we set up a Pop-up Camp and conducted<lf>an investigation into these Doshaguma?
<string>We've actually just found a site that would be perfect.<lf>I'll take you there.
<string>Much appreciated. Thanks.
<string>Come see me when you're ready to depart.
<string>How's it going, Nata?
<string>I'm worried...
<string>Do you think that the Doshaguma will attack<lf>Kunafa Village?
<string>Not sure. We're looking into it.
<string>Is there anything I can do to help?
<string>Gemma says I should "take it easy" and<lf>that it's OK to take things one step at a time...
<string>But I feel so useless! I'm not smart,<lf>I can't hunt like you...
<string>I can't even remember anything about<lf>the White Wraith...
<string>Look. These things take time. Trust me,<lf>we're going to find it.
<string>OK... If you say so.
<string>Seriously, when is this White Wraith<lf>gonna come out of hiding?
<string>...I could do with checking it off our to-do list.
<string>What? It's gone again? I know I left it here.
<string>I don't know what's going on here, but it makes zero sense.
<string>Yeah, but my bags. They're not here.<lf>Not that there was all that much in them.
<string>Don't tell me someone walked off with them...?<lf>Who would do that, though?
<string>Wait, Hunter. We should head out as a group.
<string>How many specimen bottles do you think I should bring?
<string>Ha! With you, it's always gonna<lf>be one more than you've got.
<string>Oh, there you are.
<string>Are you ready to leave?
<string>Yeah, let's head out.
<string>I need a little more time.
<string>Let's go on foot for this one. It wouldn't be fair<lf>to the others if we went by Seikret.
<string>Heh, thank you. I was starting to worry<lf>that we'd have to sprout wings to keep up.
<string>Shall we depart?
<string>We'll follow this river.
<string>Why do you think the water is red?
<string>There are a few plausible explanations.<lf>It could be an excess of certain types of plankton.
<string>Or, decaying plant matter could cause a color change,<lf>although that wouldn't explain a red this bright.
<string>If I were really reaching, I could cite reports of<lf>monsters that cause the sea to appear red...
<string>Well, in any case, don't worry. The water was<lf>completely safe to drink.
<string>You let him drink this!?
<string>Not much use in stopping him.
<string>Anyone else sense that? Small creatures,<lf>all around us.
<string>Yeah, they've been with us for a bit...
<string>Really? Can we get a specimen!?
<string>After we set up camp.
<string>Don't think they're hostile, but that's no<lf>reason to throw caution to the wind.
<string>The water is all clear.
<string>You're right, it's not red at all.
<string>Makes you wonder where it's coming from.
<string>I know! Why don't we follow the water back<lf>to its source?
<string>After we set up camp.
<string>I still can't believe the size of this forest...<lf>Every step brings another fascinating discovery.
<string>And it feels so vibrant and alive...
<string>I know! Where to even begin?<lf>So many things to study and collect...
<string>I'm about ready to dash off into the trees<lf>like a madman!
<string>That settles it. I've decided to live here.
<string>Alright, alright, enough joking around...<lf>Focus on the task at hand.
<string>Don't wander off too far now.
<string>This is the place.
<string>Good, let's set up camp. Could you signal<lf>the Support Team?
<string>OK, let the Doshaguma investigation begin.
<string>We should look for any tracks or traces.<lf>I'll assist you.

<string><COLOR FF0000>#Rejected#</COLOR> Dia_stCh0101_Ms001080_0360_t004
<string>We may have passed some clues back the way we came,<lf>so why don't we start there?
<string>Hey, look at that. Brown fur.
<string><COLOR FF0000>#Rejected#</COLOR> Dia_stCh0101_Ms001080_0380_t0010
<string>Found some brown fur over here!
<string>Let's stick together. I'm sure <lf>we'll find something here.
<string>This appears to be Doshaguma fur.
<string>However, there seems to be some diversity in<lf>the length and thickness.
<string>That would suggest that it's traveling in a pack.
<string>Let's keep looking.
<string>There's a bunch of coarse fur here.
<string>What's this? I don't think it's from a Doshaguma.
<string>Interesting, these appear to be claw marks...
<string>I found something else.
<string>Over here! Look!
<string>If it's leaving gashes like this, it must be a big one.
<string>This fur we're finding isn't quite the right color.
<string>Perhaps we're dealing with some kind of alpha?
<string>The scoutflies seem to be reacting to something<lf>deeper in.
<string>Olivia! Take Erik back to camp!
<string>The Seikret came for us!
<string>A Doshaguma!
<string>Don't get dragged into their fight!
<string>Nice work, Hunter! Let's return to Base Camp.
<string>I'd like to say that I'm used to it, but that lad<lf>always finds new ways to surprise me.
<string>Erik is safe, thanks to you. I'm grateful.
<string>He's always flitting off someplace, and I let him<lf>out of sight. That's on me. It won't happen again.
<string>I'm sorry, but you're on your own for a bit—<lf>I can't leave here until Erik fully recovers.
<string>Are you OK?
<string>Since we trespassed into its nest, that Lala Barina<lf>is going to be extremely aggressive.
<string>As an immediate threat, the Guild authorizes you<lf>to hunt it down.
<string>I owe you, Hunter, truly. I couldn't have gotten<lf>Erik out of there without your help.
<string>Yes, you have my thanks! You know, fascinatingly,<lf>I can still taste the poison in the back of my throat.
<string><COLOR FF0000>#Rejected#</COLOR> Dia_stCh0101_Ms001080_0540_t003
<string>Lovely. So, I think we're going to press on with<lf>the Doshaguma investigation. What about you?
<string>Now that Erik has come around, we can<lf>continue searching for the White Wraith.
<string>Speaking of...I spoke with Nata. He seems rather<lf>eager to help us find that thing.
<string>If you wouldn't mind, I'd like to look after him<lf>for a while. He's the only witness we have.
<string><COLOR FF0000>#Rejected#</COLOR> Dia_stCh0101_Ms001080_0540_t008
<string>Is that OK with you, Nata?
<string>...Yes. I don't want to sit here. I want to help.
<string>Thank you, I'm grateful for your help.<lf>We'll be counting on you.
<string>OK, Nata... Stay safe and good luck.
<string>Thanks.
<string>Nata will be OK... We should head back to our<lf>camp in the forest.
<string>Hunter. Borrow you a sec?
<string>Hey, have you been upgrading your weapons?
<string>And don't give me that "it's a waste of materials"<lf>nonsense. You want your gear to be effective, right?
<string>Here. I'm giving you some materials, so no excuses.<lf>Try it out.
