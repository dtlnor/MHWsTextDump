<string>Ah, there it is.
<string>That's our target. You ready to engage?
<string>Right then! Let's get this started, shall we?
<string>OK, let's let 'em have it.
<string>I say we finish this up quick and head home.
<string>Time to earn our keep, Hunter!
<string>Dang! That's a big monster.
<string>This one's enormous... Too late to cancel?
<string>This one's small—watch your positioning.
<string>It may be small, but it ain't exactly cute.
<string>Sorry, gotta fall back a minute...!
<string>This is... Whew, this is tough...
<string>You win this round...
<string>Wait's over, I'm back.
<string>Time for a little revenge.
<string>OK, chief. Bomb's in place and ready.
<string>Fireworks are ready. Time for the big show!
<string>Trap's down this way!
<string>Trap's down. Come and get it, big guy.
<string>Here ya go.
<string>Return the favor sometime.
<string>There. Go do some damage.
<string>Use this to make my job easier, yeah?
<string>Flash out!
<string>Eyes closed, buddy!
<string>Sonic bomb out!
<string>You like it loud, big guy?
<string>Sending in a dung pod!
<string>Let's relocate our friend here.
<string>Bit early for bedtime, ain't it?
<string>Time to pull it together, bud.
<string>Kinda need you with me out here, chief.
<string>Hey, don't get hit!
<string>Don't get in over your head!
<string>That's real decent of you.
<string>Ahh, just what I needed!
<string>You know I love ya, right?
<string>It's still going? Sure giving us a runaround.
<string>Looks like the end's in sight.
<string>Eyy, we bagged it!
<string>Jackpot! Let's go!
<string>I love this part. Let's go!
<string>I like how this is playing out!
<string>All right, simmer down, ya big lug!
<string>Haha! This one's a real wild ride!
<string>Ahh, you beat me to it.
<string>Ooh! Hit it where it hurts.
<string>Guess it's not quite ready to give up.
<string>We're chasing, yeah? You good to go?
<string>All this running takes it outta ya.
<string>This one's dragging us all over.
<string>Another safe return. You love to see it.
<string>Well, that wraps it up. You headed back?
<string>Nice work, buddy. See ya 'round.
<string>Whatcha wanna eat when we get back?
<string>I love teaming up with you. Easy money.
<string>Hunts don't get much smoother than that.
<string>I'm good at this, but you? Whole 'nother level.
<string>I feel sorry for monsters that cross you.
<string>Was a bit touch and go there.
<string>If everybody's in one piece, I call it a win.
<string>I'm headed out. Catch you later.
<string>Rest is on you, chief.
<string>Good so far. On to the next one.
<string>Nice work. We off to the next one?
<string>Yeah, yeah, I'm here. Sorry for the wait.
<string>Hey, having some trouble? Ha, as if.
<string>From here on out, it's life or death.
<string>Can't have you collapsing on me.
<string>Get it into the trap!
<string>If only it'd trap itself...
<string>Whoa there, in a pickle?
<string>A big one's coming.
<string>Do me a favor and don't get sent flying.
<string>It's not looking so hot, but it might still lash out.
<string>Haha! Thanks for getting trapped.
<string>Is it winding up for a big one?
<string>Here it comes! This one could be fatal!
<string>Take a nice long nap, would you?
<string>The moment we've been waiting for!
<string>That's right, go ahead and weaken each other up.
<string>Look at 'em go. Nature's terrifying sometimes.
<string>Well, guess I'll head home with you, then.
<string>Hold up, I was about to pick you. I'm serious.
