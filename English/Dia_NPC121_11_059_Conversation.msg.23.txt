<string>I was a craftsman, originally. Ornaments,<lf>accessories, and the like.
<string>Made me a stickler for small details. Even if the<lf>young folks get uppity about it.
<string>Passing on skills to others requires a tremendous<lf>amount of time and effort.
<string>It's like spending months on a single sculpture.<lf>All good things come with time and effort.
<string>A man's life can end in an instant. No finding a<lf>replacement, either. It's a hell of a treasure.
<string>All the more reason to prepare for the worst.
<string>Every action brings about change.<lf>Even if it's not visible.
<string>Whether it's polishing your work tools or taking<lf>a journey like yours, the little moments matter.
<string>Life is just a long chain of such moments, one<lf>after the next. Some ancient wisdom for you.
<string>Should Kunafa be looking to change course for<lf>the future...? What are your thoughts?
<string>Live your life appreciating each little moment.<lf>That is how our ancestors taught us to be.
<string>It's hard to teach others the value of true<lf>craftsmanship, beyond just what the eye can see.
<string>The young folk tend to cut corners to get a result<lf>quickly. I hope they'll come to understand.
<string>There comes a time when you realize that worrying<lf>about the village's future won't change it.
<string>But I hold faith that the accessories I made with<lf>my own two hands will keep the young folk safe.
<string>Rest your spirit awhile. Peaceful days like these<lf>are a blessing.
