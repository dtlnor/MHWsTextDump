<string>I was a craftsman, originally. Ornaments,<lf>accessories, and the like.
<string>Made me a stickler for small details.<lf>Even if the young folks get uppity about it.
<string>Passing on skills to others requires a tremendous<lf>amount of time and effort.
<string>It's like spending months on a single sculpture.<lf>All good things come with time and effort.
<string>Life can end in an instant. No finding<lf>a replacement, either. It's a hell of a treasure.
<string>All the more reason to prepare for the worst.
<string>Every action brings about change.<lf>Even if it's not visible.
<string>Whether it's polishing your work tools or taking<lf>a journey like yours, the little moments matter.
<string>Life is just a long chain of such moments,<lf>one after the next. Some ancient wisdom for you.
<string>Should Kunafa be looking to change course for<lf>the future...? What are your thoughts?
<string>Live your life appreciating each little moment.<lf>That is how our ancestors taught us to be.
<string>It's hard to teach others the value of true<lf>craftsmanship, beyond just what the eye can see.
<string>The young folk tend to cut corners to get a result<lf>quickly. I hope they'll come to understand.
<string>There comes a time when you realize that worrying<lf>about the village's future won't change it.
<string>But I hold faith that the accessories I made with<lf>my own two hands will keep the young folk safe.
<string>Rest your spirit awhile. Peaceful days like these<lf>are a blessing.
<string>The impending Sandtide is a troubling one.<lf>I ask only that you do not get in my way.
<string>The village seems strangely abuzz. Has something<lf>happened?
<string>Most of the decorations Zatoh wears were made by<lf>my own hands.
<string>I can only pray they serve and protect him well...
<string>It seems we grew overconfident that the gemchimes<lf>alone would keep us safe.
<string>We'll need to revisit the design of the gemchimes<lf>we're using now.
<string>I must say, you really are a marvel...<lf>I am astonished.
<string>Where did you learn such techniques? They surely<lf>did not come from living the way we do here.
<string>I heard the news from Zatoh. That you banished a<lf>truly frightening threat.
<string>The feats you manage are stunning, traveler.<lf>I can see how you've earned Zatoh's respect...
<string>Hmm... It's clear you are walking a grander path<lf>than I can fathom.
<string>You draw upon a prodigious well of experience.<lf>A long chain of tiny moments.
<string>Requests for protective ornaments have picked up.<lf>It's a busy time, but the work is fulfilling.
<string>We did not lose a single life here, thanks to<lf>what you all have done.
<string>I am grateful.
<string>The Elder made the trip here to ask<lf>after you, not long ago.
<string>Where you came from, where this West you<lf>talk about is.
<string>Your tale may become a legend, someday.<lf>I hope it does.
<string>The young folk are full of energy these days.<lf>Seems a new wind has begun to blow.
<string>I'm taking a lesson from them and trying to view<lf>each little moment with fresh eyes.
