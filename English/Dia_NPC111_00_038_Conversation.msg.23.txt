<string>Thank you for all your hard work, Hunter!<lf>I hope all is going smoothly?
<string>A climate this unstable is a serious threat.
<string>We must all take care to adapt...<lf>We can't afford to get sick now.
<string>Fabius has such a formidable aura. Even now,<lf>I get nervous when standing before him.
<string>The other day, I was answering him and my voice<lf>cracked... I nearly fainted from embarrassment.
<string>Good day. Word of your<lf>accomplishments has reached us.
<string>But then, I would expect no less of a fierce<lf>competitor that has earned Fabius's trust.
<string>Ahh, you must be the one...<lf>Fabius has spoken of you in high regard.
<string>My name is Cobb. I've been charged with this post.<lf>It's an honor to meet you, Hunter.
<string>I have been in Fabius's service<lf>for a number of years, now...
<string>But despite my best efforts to be of help to him,<lf>I fear he's been the one to help me instead.
<string>I must take those feelings of frustration and<lf>channel them into my training.
<string>Fabius has returned to the Academy<lf>to continue his investigations there.
<string>He will return as soon as he has an answer. Rest<lf>assured, we'll keep this place safe until then!
<string>Good to see you, Hunter. At present, there are no<lf>irregularities to report.
<string>Rex seemed quite affected by the cold, but I'm<lf>well accustomed to it by now.
<string>Fabius had only the highest praise for your<lf>accomplishments, Hunter.
<string>Gah! I want to make some real contributions and<lf>gain his praise, too!
<string>But all I can do now is faithfully execute the<lf>orders I'm given.
<string>I'll keep moving forward, one step at a time.
<string>What makes a first-rate hunter? Until now, I had<lf>always looked to Fabius as my example.
<string>But you, in your own distinct way, are no less<lf>the first-rate hunter he is.
<string>I will be learning all I can from you from now on.
