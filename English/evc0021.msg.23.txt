<string>Stay here.
<string>Come on.
<string>Yes! Yes! Big YES!
<string>Zatoh!
<string>Travelers!
<string>I didn't expect to see YOU way out here.<lf>Are you all together?
<string>We ran into each other near Base Camp.
<string>So my unit offered to accompany them<lf>on the road.
<string>Where to?
<string>A village among the oilsprings.
<string>We make the trip there after<lf>every Sandtide to trade.
<string>Where is this place?
<string>Beyond the forest. They are well-known for<lf>their craftsmanship.
<string>The Stone, Bone, and Oilfolk that dwell there have<lf>been perfecting their art since ancient times.
<string>Move out.
<string>You are looking for your home, yes?
<string>A land rich in history might be the perfect place<lf>to find answers.
<string>Let us travel there together.
<string>Home...
<string>Yes, take me with you!
<string>I'd like to see this place too.
<string>I did not expect to travel with so many,<lf>but the more the merrier.
<string>Thank you!
<string>Thank you!
<string>Alright, everyone. Let's mount up!
