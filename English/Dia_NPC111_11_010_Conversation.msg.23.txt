<string>Need something from me?
<string>If there's nothing I can help you with...
<string>The people here?
<string>Why don't you ask them yourself?<lf>I'm not much for gossip.
<string>Y'sai?
<string>Yeah, I work with the kid sometimes. He's got<lf>nothing for muscle and is nice to a fault.
<string>You wanna know about Zatoh?
<string>Go ask him yourself. Not like he's hiding.
<string>This village?
<string>You ask a lot of difficult questions. Not like<lf>I got anything else to compare it to.
<string>Heh... Need something?
<string>...Sorry. The Plenty's got me a little giddy.
<string>The livestock?
<string>Better companions than people, I'll tell ya that.<lf>Tough. Hard workers. What more can ya ask for.
<string>...Nona, huh?
<string>Don't talk much to kids, so I can't really say.<lf>Good kid though. Fast runner, too.
<string>The village Elder?
<string>She's gotta stern look to her, but she's just making<lf>things up as she goes, really. Funny lady.
<string>You're...
<string>Ahh, right. Y'sai's guest. Greetings, and all that.
<string>You wanna know about Zatoh?
<string>Beast of a Seikret rider. You should see<lf>it for yourself.
<string>The direction of the Oasis, eh?
<string>Walk toward the Plains. You'll know it when<lf>you see it. Not much else I can say here.
<string>Heard from the Elder what you did. That was<lf>mighty kind of ya. Thanks.
<string>Keep stopping by. It's always great to chat.
<string>Guess you were a beast of a<lf>Seikret rider, yourself.
<string>The Wind's Gasp?
<string>You went out there, in <ITALIC>that</ITALIC>?<lf>Do you have a survival instinct in that body?
<string>Hey now, why're you talking to me?
<string>I've got nothing for you. Go ask the Elder<lf>or something.
<string>My job? Muscle work, mostly.
<string>I'm just human, though. Can't compete with the<lf>livestock when it comes to muscle.
<string>We're saved...
<string>No, lemme try that again. You saved us. Thank you.
<string>Sorry, I got nothing more to say than last time.
<string>Don't have any tales that'd be of interest.
<string>But, eh. As long as you don't mind, feel free<lf>to stop by.
<string>Whenever you tell me about your travels, I really<lf>can't wrap my head around it...
<string>You really don't got a lick of common sense, do ya?<lf>Er, sorry. Sounded a bit harsh.
