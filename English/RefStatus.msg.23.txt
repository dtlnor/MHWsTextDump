<string>When your health is running low, I'll<lf>send you a Vigorwasp! But I won't be<lf>able to send you another one for<lf>a little while after that.
<string>I'll draw a monster's attention with<lf>a special shield that makes noise!<lf>That'll give you time to get in<lf>position or attack.
<string>I can deliver a Purewasp to purr-ify<lf>you of any blights or abnormal<lf>statuses. I'll be there to save your<lf>tail any time you're in a bind so<lf>you can focus on the hunt!
<string>I'll set a special Felyne-only<lf>shock trap that looks like an<lf>acorn! If you get a monster to<lf>go over to where it is, they'll<lf>get paralyzed. This'll be great<lf>for captures!
<string>I'll shoot some special thorny<lf>ammo from my trusty Felyne<lf>ballista! If all goes well, it could<lf>even create a monster wound.
<string>Wanna put even more force<lf>behind your attacks at just the<lf>right moment? If I play this Song<lf>o' Power you'll be stronger fur<lf>sure!
<string>It's only natural to be nervous about<lf>facing an opponent you lost to before.<lf>But don't worry—my Purrtection<lf>Purrformance will boost your defense<lf>and keep you safe the next time you<lf>face 'em!
<string>I'll use a special fragrance to attract<lf>wild Vigorwasps! It'll even make them<lf>come swarming in places where they<lf>don't normally live. ...Does it really<lf>smell that good?
<string>I'll place a cage of Flashflies for you<lf>to use whenever! They're really good<lf>at blinding monsters, but some<lf>monsters get more aggressive when<lf>they're blinded, so be careful!
<string>Never give up, even if you run<lf>out of health. 'Cause I'll be right<lf>there with a Vigorwasp to revive<lf>you! The only thing is, I can't use<lf>it again right away, and it also<lf>doesn't restore that much health.
<string>Gemma and I have finally completed<lf>our masterpiece: Rath-from-Above!<lf>Now I can provide covering fire.<lf>I might even shoot down a wyvern!
<string>Not enough materials? That's what I'm<lf>here for! Introducing the Plunderang:<lf>a boomerang that lets me snatch<lf>materials from monsters!
<string>I can deliver even better<lf>Vigorwasps! Not only do they<lf>restore more health, but if I time<lf>it right I can send a bunch in a row!
<string>Now that I've gotten the hang of this<lf>shield, I can draw monsters' attention<lf>for even longer! And that's not all—<lf>I can counterattack, too!
<string>Status effects stink, right? But I've<lf>got two Purewasps on paw— er,<lf>hand now, so I can send them one<lf>right after another if you need!
<string>We Felynes have figured out how<lf>to upgrade the paracorn. I can<lf>use it more often now, which<lf>should come in handy!
<string>I can use Let-'Er-RRRip for an even<lf>longer time now. So even if I miss<lf>my target, I can keep firing!
<string>I think my Sporenet playing has gotten<lf>even better! Maybe that's why my songs<lf>have more powerful effects. Now you'll<lf>get even stronger for even longer!
<string>I'm a musical genius! My songs are<lf>even more effective. If you take<lf>on an opponent twice, I can raise<lf>your defense higher for longer!
<string>I've finally learned how to attract<lf>Giant Vigorwasps! *sniff sniff*<lf>Yeah, that smells amazing!
<string>Flashfly Cages sure are handy, huh?<lf>So I figured out a way to lay them<lf>more frequently. Try to use them<lf>when the time's just right!
<string>Now that's what I call vigor! I can<lf>restore even more health when<lf>reviving you with a Vigorwasp. But<lf>don't get sloppy out there, meow!
<string>I improved the Rath-from-Above!<lf>Now I'll plunge at a monster<lf>just before I'm outta air time.<lf>That's what I call a huge hit!
<string>I've gotten better with the<lf>Plunderang, which means more<lf>plundered spoils! I hope I can use<lf>it to get the materials you want.
