<string>When your health is running low,<lf>I'll send you a Vigorwasp!<lf>But I won't be able to send you<lf>another one for a little while<lf>after that.
<string>I'll draw a monster's attention<lf>with a special shield that makes<lf>noise! That'll give you time to<lf>get in position or attack.
<string>I can deliver a Purewasp to<lf>purr-ify any blights or abnormal<lf>statuses. I'll be there to save<lf>your tail any time you're in<lf>a bind so you can focus on<lf>the hunt!
<string>I'll set a special Felyne-only<lf>shock trap that looks like an<lf>acorn! If you get a monster to<lf>go over to where it is, they'll<lf>get paralyzed. This'll be great<lf>for captures!
<string>I'll shoot some special thorny<lf>ammo from my trusty Felyne<lf>ballista! If all goes well, it could<lf>even create a monster wound.
<string>Wanna put even more force<lf>behind your attacks at just the<lf>right moment? If I play this Song<lf>o' Power you'll be stronger fur<lf>sure!
<string>It's only natural to be nervous<lf>when facing an opponent you lost<lf>to before. But don't worry—<lf>my Purrtection performance will<lf>boost your defense and keep you<lf>safe the next time you face 'em!
<string>I'll use a special fragrance to<lf>attract wild Vigorwasps! It'll<lf>even make them swarm in places<lf>where they don't normally live. <lf>...Does it really smell that<lf>good?
<string>I'll place a cage of Flashflies<lf>for you to use whenever! They're<lf>quite good at blinding monsters,<lf>but some monsters get more<lf>aggressive when they're blinded,<lf>so be careful!
<string>Never give up, even if you run<lf>out of health. I'll be right<lf>there with a Vigorwasp to revive<lf>you! The only thing is, I can't<lf>use it again right away, and it<lf>won't restore that much health.
<string>Gemma and I have finally<lf>completed our masterpiece:<lf>Rath-from-Above! Now I can<lf>provide covering fire. I might<lf>even shoot down a wyvern!
<string>Not enough materials? That's<lf>what I'm here for! Introducing<lf>the Plunderang: a boomerang that<lf>lets me snatch materials from<lf>monsters!
<string>I can deliver even better<lf>Vigorwasps! Not only do they<lf>restore more health, but if I time<lf>it right I can send a bunch in a row!
<string>Now that I have the hang of this<lf>shield, I can draw monsters'<lf>attention for even longer! And I<lf>can counterattack, too!
<string>Status ailments stink, right? But<lf>I've got two Purewasps on paw—er,<lf>hand now, so I can send them one<lf>right after another if you need!
<string>We Felynes have figured out how<lf>to upgrade the paracorn. I can<lf>use it more often now, which<lf>should come in handy!
<string>I can use Let-'Er-RRRip for an even<lf>longer time now. So even if I miss<lf>my target, I can keep firing!
<string>I think my Sporenet playing got<lf>better! Maybe that's why my song<lf>effects are more potent. You'll<lf>get even stronger for longer!
<string>I'm a musical genius! My songs are<lf>even more effective. If you take<lf>on an opponent twice, I can raise<lf>your defense higher for longer!
<string>I've finally learned how to attract<lf>Giant Vigorwasps! *sniff sniff*<lf>Yeah, that smells amazing!
<string>Flashfly Cages sure are handy, huh?<lf>So I figured out a way to lay them<lf>more frequently. Try to use them<lf>when the time's just right!
<string>Now that's what I call vigor! I can<lf>restore even more health when<lf>reviving you with a Vigorwasp. But<lf>don't get sloppy out there, meow!
<string>I improved the Rath-from-Above!<lf>Now I'll plunge at a monster<lf>just before I'm outta air time.<lf>That's what I call a huge hit!
<string>I've gotten better with the<lf>Plunderang, which means more<lf>plundered spoils! I hope I can use<lf>it to get the materials you want.
