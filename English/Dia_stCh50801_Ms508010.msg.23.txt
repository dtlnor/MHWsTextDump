<string>Excuse me. I had a question, if I might...?
<string>Of course.
<string>Is... Is it normal for monsters to fight with each<lf>other for days on end?
<string>Well, it's not uncommon for monsters to engage in<lf>territorial struggles.
<string>But fights stretching over multiple days are rare.<lf>Where were they?
<string>The Land of Blessed Winds. The Vanguard have seen them<lf>at it every time they go to quarry gemchime stone.
<string>The monsters seem too focused on each other to<lf>pay the Vanguard much mind, but I still worry...
<string>You're right to. It may just be good luck that's<lf>kept them from being attacked so far.
<string>I'm not keen to wait until that luck runs out.<lf>We'll investigate those monsters on our end.
<string>Thank you, I appreciate that. And you... I'm sure<lf>you'll be fine, but do be careful.
<string>Do you have a moment? It's about those monsters in<lf>the Land of Blessed Winds.
<string>They were as dangerous as you suspected, but your<lf>report allowed us to deal with them early. Thank you.
<string>I'm glad to hear it. Less glad that threats like<lf>that were so close to us here...
<string>What will come of the village if more turn up...?
<string>That's what we're here for. Feel free to ask for help anytime.
<string>That does make me feel better. Thank you.
<string>I hope you'll let us help you as well, then.
<string>The whole village will do what we can to support<lf>you, Hunter.
<string>Thanks. I appreciate it.
