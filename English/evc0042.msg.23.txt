<string>Excuse me. My name is Alma.
<string>I was wondering if you could help us.
<string>Welcome. I have been expecting you.
<string>Are you...the Allhearken?
<string>The Keepers have been known<lf>to call me that, yes.
<string>It's an honor to meet you. We've come to—
<string>I know, child. I have already heard.
<string>So we meet at last... If I may?
<string>My word.
<string>How tired you must be. We will find—
<string>Wait...
<string>Please tell me!
<string>I'm one of the Keepers. My name is Nata.
<string>There's a Guardian that attacked our village...<lf>The one called Arkveld...
<string>And you desire to know why it did this.
<string>Yes. Why did it escape? Why did it start hunting?
<string>Do you know why the Guardians came<lf>into existence?
<string>Because the Keepers created them?
<string>Come with me.
<string>This was your capital...Wyveria.
<string>In a time long before our reckoning.
<string>The people of Wyveria created the Dragontorch,<lf>a source of limitless energy.
<string>They channeled this energy along the Wyrmways,<lf>wielding its power in every corner of the land.
<string>At times it was lightning to dispel monsters...
<string>Or a heavy downpour to cleanse poisons<lf>discarded upon the land...
<string>It was fire to forge precious materials...
<string>And it negated the very weight of buildings<lf>so they could mount the sky.
<string>Nature's laws were no more than a suggestion to them.
<string>Their crowning achievement was the Guardians—
<string>a host of servile creatures to do their bidding.
<string>Wyveria's supremacy was beyond question.
<string>If that's the case, how did such a glorious city<lf>come to ruin?
<string>They invited calamity upon themselves.
<string>After the people were put to rout,<lf>the Guardians fell into a deep slumber.
<string>But...Arkveld woke up.
<string>What is Arkveld?<lf>What should the Keepers do?
<string>Please, my uncle said that you would have the answers!
<string>Where that creature's transformation will end<lf>even I cannot say.
<string>That must disappoint you. I am sorry.
<string>But even I cannot give you the perfect<lf>explanation you seek.
<string>You and I are the same. We live amongst<lf>a collection of brief moments.
<string>The world is changed by their influence.
<string>When all of these uncountable moments have passed,<lf>where will Arkveld be? Where will you?
<string>My role is to watch. And listen.
<string>You feel responsible for this Guardian?
<string>Yes, I'm a Keeper.
<string>No, that's not why.
<string>I...I want to know what will happen to Arkveld.
<string>If my friends are with me, we can learn and help.
<string>If that is your choice, then go forth, child.<lf>Stand witness to how its existence unfolds.
<string>So much beauty...
<string>Everything is truly, truly beautiful.
