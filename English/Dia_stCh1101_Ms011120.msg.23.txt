<string>Nata mentioned wanting to speak with you.<lf>I believe it's about Arkveld.
<string>Alright then.
<string>Um, there was something I wanted to report...
<string>I'd like to talk at the Plains Base Camp, if you<lf>don't mind?
<string>Alright, then. I'll meet you there.
<string>Thank you for coming. I'm grateful.

<string>The egg we found... The one we thought might<lf>be from Arkveld? Looks like we were right.

<string>I went around talking to people,<lf>to gather what info I could.
<string>Scraps from its feeding, bits of eggshell—<lf>There's still not very much to go on, but...
<string>It found a way to live. These creatures—<lf>their will to survive... Amazing.
<string>Yeah. Especially if it found a way to overcome its<lf>nature as a Guardian. So, what's troubling you?
<string><COLOR FF0000>#Rejected#</COLOR> Dia_stCh1101_Ms011120_0020_t012
<string>Well...people at other Base Camps were saying<lf>the state it's leaving its prey in isn't normal.
<string>An Uth Duna and Nu Udra both showed signs of<lf>being attacked. And what was left was...awful.
<string>I wonder if that means it's unable to control its<lf>appetite. Like the one we saw at the Dragontorch.

<string><COLOR FF0000>#Rejected#</COLOR> Dia_stCh1101_Ms011120_0020_t016
<string>I don't know. That's why I asked for Erik's help...<lf>I thought we should hear what he has to say together.
<string><COLOR FF0000>#Rejected#</COLOR> Dia_stCh1101_Ms011120_0020_t017
<string>How interesting...
<string>I had heard talk of that egg as well, so I'm just<lf>as excited as you... But this isn't all good news.
<string><COLOR FF0000>#Rejected#</COLOR> Dia_stCh1101_Ms011120_0030_t003
<string><COLOR FF0000>#Rejected#</COLOR> Dia_stCh1101_Ms011120_0030_t004
<string>The fact that it's run roughshod over<lf>two apex predators troubles me as well.
<string>This sort of sounds like the Frenzy to me.<lf>Erik, what do you think?
<string>Too difficult to say, but...in Arkveld's case,<lf>specifically, it may not be due to infection.
<string>For instance... Nata, are you familiar with the<lf>concept of bioconcentration?
<string>No, I'm not...
<string>Right, then I'll explain. This is still just a theory,<lf>but it's been on my mind as of late.
<string>The Frenzy caused an uncontrolled spike in<lf>the Dragontorch's energy output before, right?
<string>But it may have been more than just "bad weather"<lf>that caused those apex predators to rampage.
<string><COLOR FF0000>#Rejected#</COLOR> Dia_stCh1101_Ms011120_0030_t012
<string><COLOR FF0000>#Rejected#</COLOR> Dia_stCh1101_Ms011120_0030_t013
<string>Our analysis showed that the virus caused a subtle<lf>mutation in the energy the Dragontorch produced.
<string>That means the Wyvern Milk itself may have come<lf>to contain tiny traces of the virus's characteristics.
<string>I'm starting to see where this is heading. Then<lf>the mutated energy started flowing out...
<string>Exactly. It gradually tainted the water supply,<lf>animals, plants, insects, and on to monsters—
<string>If it traveled up the food chain, growing more<lf>concentrated at every step...
<string>Its eventual destination would be the dominant<lf>predator of each region.
<string>That may be why that Uth Duna and other monsters<lf>exhibited such aggression. A sort of pseudo-Frenzy.
<string>And then, at the very end of the chain, Arkveld<lf>comes and siphons those monsters' energy...
<string><COLOR FF0000>#Rejected#</COLOR> Dia_stCh1101_Ms011120_0030_t021
<string>And in so doing, it may be assimilating their traits—<lf>essentially distilling the Frenzy virus.
<string>And after it finally found the strength to live<lf>again... Poor thing.
<string>But, from the reports we've heard, it sounds as if<lf>we're only dealing with one affected individual.
<string>I believe so. And there's been no reports of Rey Dau<lf>being attacked yet. This is our chance.

<string>Hey... We should talk to Nata before heading out.
<string>I was planning to.
<string>You're going, aren't you? To the Wind's Gasp...<lf>To Rey Dau.
<string>Yes. There's a good chance Arkveld<lf>will turn up there.
<string>Could I... I'd like to come with you, please.
<string>You heard Erik's theory. You know it's too<lf>dangerous, Nata.
<string>I'm still just an apprentice hunter, I know...<lf>I can't do anything yet. But I'm also a Keeper.
<string>So, please. It found its way to life. Let me at<lf>least watch over it... And over you.
<string>The answer is no.
<string>I don't need someone who's just going to watch.
<string>...
<string>But. Given how far you've come, I feel you're<lf>capable now of more than that.
<string>Don't be a passive observer. Use your head<lf>and think for yourself.
<string><COLOR FF0000>#Rejected#</COLOR> Dia_stCh1101_Ms011120_0050_t012
<string>Promise you'll do that, and you can come.
<string>I will! I promise! ...Thank you!
<string>OK. I'm ready to leave anytime.
<string>Let's get moving then.
<string>Any word from the people?
<string>I'd like a bit longer to prepare.
<string>Right! Let's go.
<string>OK. Let me know whenever you're ready.
<string>I'm glad you could join us, Nata.
<string>So am I.
<string>Have you been looking into Arkveld this whole<lf>time? Ever since that egg?
<string>I asked around while we were traveling,<lf>or while I was helping out at Base Camp.
<string>Whenever you were out in the field, I was trying<lf>to piece things together on my own. ...Um, sorry.
<string>Don't be. I understand the feeling well. Whatever<lf>the undertaking, it all starts from curiosity.
<string>I'm certainly the same way.
<string>And this investigation all started from the data<lf>you collected, Nata. Quite the achievement.
<string>She's right. It's impressive.
<string>Oh, um... If you say so. Thanks.
<string>A Doshaguma...
<string>Did Arkveld do this, too?
<string>Not sure...but it doesn't show any signs of being<lf>fed on. That rules out Rey Dau.
<string>This looks like the result of one single,<lf>devastating blow...
<string>Let's proceed with caution.
<string>The weather's picking up. We should hurry.
<string>Right. The Sandtide is gonna put Rey Dau in an agitated<lf>state. If it's gonna strike, it'll strike then.
<string>...
<string>There... Balahara.
<string>Doesn't look like it was dinner, either. More<lf>like the result of an uncontrollable impulse.

<string>...
<string>Well then, let's get to it!
<string>When you're ready, accept the quest<lf>to continue the investigation.
<string>I'm glad you're safe. It really did seem as fierce<lf>as a Frenzied monster.
<string>No question. I'm also sure its ability to absorb<lf>elements is what let it shed its Guardian nature.
<string>It's a shame that unique strength became<lf>its fatal weakness...
<string>A harsh irony... Well, we should be going.<lf>Nata is waiting for us.
<string>Right.
<string>That was unfortunate...
<string>It's OK. Because I know how strong Arkveld is.
<string>There are others like it that found a way<lf>to return to what they truly were.
<string>One day, they'll find their place. And become<lf>a part of this world again.
<string>I'm sure they will. Nature is— Life is a lot<lf>more resilient than we humans know.
<string>Yeah, I sure hope so.
<string>Well, let's get to it, then.
<string>Huh?
<string>You wanna know, right? Let's start investigating.
<string>Yeah, let's go! You in?
<string>Of course I'm in!
<string>Yeah, me too!
<string>Let's go!
<string>I had a dream that day. I saw a bird flying <lf>overhead and thought...
<string>That the Arkveld that was born could fly freely<lf>like that bird.
<string>I think that's what the world was trying to tell me.
<string>It was a really good dream.
<string>Life sure is a valuable thing, right, Hunter?
<string>Arkveld can't control its own strength. It looked<lf>like it was in a really unstable state.
<string>But there's nothing I can do... Have you ever<lf>experienced something like this, Hunter?
<string>I'd like if you could tell me about it sometime.<lf>It will be something for me to work towards.
<string>Alma knows more about Arkveld than I do.<lf>I'll leave this investigation to you two.
<string>Sounds good.
<string>Nata wants to speak with you about Arkveld.
<string>He asked Alma to come, too.<lf>Let's all meet at the Plains Base Camp.
