<string>This confirms it.
<string>Yeah. It's all one huge structure.
<string>I can't imagine anyone building something<lf>like this back home, let alone this size!
<string>How'd they even do it?
<string>It's unlike any architecture I've seen.
<string>Which immediately raises some questions...
<string>Who exactly built it?
<string>And, what happened to their civilization if they were<lf>capable of something like this?
<string>And...if the Keepers live out here...who are they?
<string>Your cheeks are red. You cold?
<string>I'm fine.
<string>What's that?
<string>Hirabami!
<string>Is it wiser to use a needle to fight<lf>or to hide it in a haystack?
<string>Hiding in the haystack!
<string>Then follow me.
<string>Where are we?
<string>My quiet sanctuary.
<string>I come here when I'm in need of solitude.
<string>I can't believe there was a whole nest.
<string>We'll just have to wait out the danger in here.
<string>How 'bout we set up camp, then?
<string>Your small hovel? Certainly.
