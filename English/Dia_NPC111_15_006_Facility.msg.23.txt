<string>Greetings. Kismet sees our paths meet again.
<string>Well met.
<string>I've collected up a variety of things.<lf>Any interest?
<string>It seems my collecting has really<lf>begun to take off, recently.

<string>Could you help me gather items?
<string>(End Conversation)
<string>How's it going?
<string>Life has its portion of sadness and grief, but I<lf>believe those exist apart from our way.
<string>Do you have the word "kismet" on the outside, too?<lf>It is a thing I choose to honor.
<string>It seems kismet has moved me to gather things of<lf>use for you. If it urges you, let us speak again.
<string>Hey, I got what you requested.
<string>Alright, I'm on it.
<string>I'll pick some up while I'm out.
<string>Alright. Some other time, then.
<string>Be careful out there.
<string>Look forward to it.
<string>Sorry for the wait. Here you are.
<string>This is everything.
<string>Is there anything you want me to get?
<string>Do inform me of anything you want.
