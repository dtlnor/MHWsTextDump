<string>Hey, have you heard about the strange rumors<lf>floating around Kunafa lately?
<string>They may be nothing more than just that, of course.
<string>Still, they could be worth looking into.<lf>Let's do it.
<string>It seems prudent. If nothing else, it may put some<lf>worries to rest.
<string>There's talk of strange rumors floating around<lf>Kunafa lately. Have you heard?
<string>It's possible they're nothing more than just that,<lf>of course.
<string>Still, they could be worth looking into.<lf>Let's do it.
<string>It seems prudent. If nothing else, it'll<lf>put their worries to rest.
<string>What do I do... Maybe tell a grown-up...?<lf>No, I'll just get in trouble...
<string>Um, hey traveler?<lf>Can I, um, tell you something?
<string>No, sorry. It's OK. Never mind...
<string>If you want to talk, I'm here to listen.
<string>Really? That's too bad.
<string>Y-Yeah. I-It's nothing...
<string>Right, this is definitely more Alma's wheelhouse.<lf>Let me go find her.
<string>I'll go work on my own research. Come poke me<lf>if you need anything.
<string>What did you want to talk about, Neby?<lf>Don't worry, I promise no one will be mad.
<string>And the Hunter here is going to help make<lf>whatever's bothering you better.
<string>Well... Nemmo and Vuno said they're going<lf>to do the Seikret rider's trial. So they...
<string>They went up to the plateau all alone!
<string>Even though we were told not to because<lf>of the strange monster...
<string>There have been sighting reports of an unknown<lf>monster around the village lately.
<string>The grown-ups said the monster was chasing<lf>after the Seikret.
<string>But Nemmo said he wasn't scared!<lf>I didn't want him angry at me, and...
<string>Does anyone else know about this, Neby?
<string>Yeah, Nona does... She just left on her Seikret.
<string>Thank you for telling us. We'll go make sure everyone<lf>is all right. You wait right here.
<string>Neby? What's wrong, child? What's the matter?
<string>Nana, can we leave Neby here in your care?
<string>We need to head for the plateau as soon as possible.
<string>Go on, then. I'll watch over the girl.<lf>You just be careful yourselves.
<string>Let's go.
<string>Give her back!
<string>Nona, be careful!
<string>No, we can't lose her!
<string>The Seikret...!
<string>NOOO!
<string>Come get me! Leave that Seikret alone!
<string>Nona!
<string>You're something else, kid. Now, get these<lf>Seikret back home!
<string>OK!
<string>I've sent the other two back safely!
<string>For the safety of the nearby settlement, the Guild<lf>authorizes you to slay that Seregios!
<string>Understood!
<string>I was flying! I...was really flying!
<string>My heart is still beating so fast...
<string>Thank you so much for coming, <PLNAME>!
<string>I've never seen a monster like that before.<lf>Its scales and talons were so sharp...
<string>If you didn't come when you did...
<string>Thank you, traveler! Look! Everyone...!
<string>Everyone came back...! I'm so glad!
<string>That's why you should always ask a grown-up for<lf>help if you're in trouble.
<string>Cuz if you don't, you'll be in even BIGGER trouble...
<string>That Seregios is not happy about us stealing the Seikret<lf>back from it.
<string>You are authorized to hunt it before it causes<lf>more trouble.
<string>A Seregios's signature weapon is its bladescales,<lf>which can cause bleeding.
<string>Eating a ration or some wild jerky will patch<lf>you right up.
<string>Fantastic work. The children and Seikret<lf>are also safe.
<string>Nana is watching over them now.<lf>Let's make our way back to Kunafa as well.
<string>Children are forbidden from attempting the trial<lf>alone... Why did you break this rule?
<string>We just wanted to be real Seikret riders...
<string>That way we could be Zatoh's hands,<lf>and help everyone around the village!
<string>I see. You were in a hurry to grow up.
<string>But rules like that exist for a reason, child.<lf>They are made to keep you safe.
<string>Alas, people forget the sting of loss as the<lf>years pass...
<string>What do we do if we forget, though?
<string>That is why we tell stories. We pass on knowledge of<lf>danger through generations so that it may be avoided.
<string>Nona, I heard about the Seregios! Are you OK?
<string>She's the reason that Seikret made it home safely.
<string>She glided down from the plateau like she was<lf>a bird herself.
<string>Wow! That means you're an official Seikret<lf>rider, right?
<string>Heh heh...
<string>Things only ended well this time thanks<lf>to the traveler and Alma.
<string>Nona, Nemmo, Vuno. You are never to do that again.<lf>If you insist on breaking any further rules...
<string>You'll find out why they called me Nana<lf>the Howling Gale... Any questions?
<string>We're really sorry! We won't do it again!
<string>Good. Lesson learned.
