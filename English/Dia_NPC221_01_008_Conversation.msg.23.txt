<string>You're a hunter, right?<lf>I can tell from the look in your eyes.
<string>Word of advice: don't forget to look back<lf>every once in a while.
<string>Especially as you get older.
<string>You want to know why I came to the Forbidden Lands?<lf>That lance-wielding feller cajoled me into it.
<string>No matter where I go, he hunts me down with<lf>a grin on his face. Mighty stubborn, that one...
<string>You get the feeling you've seen me<lf>somewhere before? Hmm...
<string>Sorry, but you hunters all look the same to me.
<string>This takes me back to Dundorma, it does. Honestly,<lf>I'm shocked I can even remember that far back!
<string>This world is filled with priceless treasures.
<string>With this song at my side, I'm always<lf>ready to craft for you.
<string>I've been traveling the world for a long time, now.<lf>Long enough to get saddled with a silly nickname.
<string>"Legend"? Pshaw. I simply live my life in pursuit<lf>of my next creation.
<string>And that's brought me here. So while I'm around,<lf>I'll train little Gem to be the best there is.
<string>She's got real potential, that one. Ho ho ho!
<string>Name's Legend. Though some call me<lf>the Myth of Legend.
<string>At least that's what Gem calls me.<lf>Ho ho ho! That little tinker!
