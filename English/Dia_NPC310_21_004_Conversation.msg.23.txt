<string>Gets real dry out there. Don't forget to hydrate.
<string>...Oh, it's you, Hunter. Thought you were one<lf>of my crew at first.
<string>Pay attention to your surroundings when you're<lf>hauling freight, pal.
<string>...Oh, it's you, Hunter. Thought you were one<lf>of my crew at first.
<string>I may be short, but I'm stacked like a brick wall.
<string>Reckon I could give you a run for your zenny<lf>in arm wrestling. Wanna find out?
<string>Welcome, welcome! How're you doing, Hunter?
<string>Never forget our motto: Safety first!
<string>We're prepping that camp construction now.
<string>We'll set you up a camp that can weather this,<lf>uh...weather. You can count on it!
<string>Hate to see a camp go down. We built that one<lf>to last.
<string>Ahhh, what a perfect day! Reckon we'll find some<lf>new materials in this weather.
<string>How many sandstorms is this, now? And how 'bout<lf>that, not one dent in our Base Camp, eh? Ehh?
<string>Heh heh heh. We welcome any and all praise here.
<string>Hey there, Hunter. You look like you're in top<lf>form today.
<string>Nice work out there, Hunter! You think things will<lf>calm down a bit now?
<string>Guess it doesn't make much difference in the<lf>work we do either way, eh?
<string>You seen Fabius? A guy doesn't look like that<lf>without a whole lot of training and experience.
<string>In terms of raw muscle...he's almost<lf>a match for me!
<string>...Things are crazy out there.
<string>So what I'm hearing is this whole region<lf>basically caught a cold?
<string>You're still working on your investigation, yeah?
<string>Next time you find somewhere new, we'll have a base<lf>set up there for you in two shakes of my tail.
<string>Building something from the ground up in an<lf>unfamiliar land... It's been a good experience.
<string>Every region's got its own building materials,<lf>so we've really upped our game here.
