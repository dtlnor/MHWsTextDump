<string>I almost didn't recognize Nata. It's clear at a<lf>glance that he's experienced what few have.
<string>He's accomplished so much here,<lf>as have the rest of you.
<string>Though I will reside here awhile, you all will<lf>continue driving the investigation.
<string>I will let my duties to the Guild and my own<lf>curiosity guide me. I invite you to do the same.
<string>Have you already met with Rex and Cobb, then?
<string>We've split up to more efficiently cover the<lf>Hollow.
<string>Just how was such a massive fissure formed, and<lf>why does it draw in monsters?
<string>I'm torn between wanting to uncover this chapter of<lf>Wyveria's history and feeling we ought not to.
<string>Few monsters I've investigated have left quite so<lf>deep an impression as Gore Magala.
<string>I'd go so far as to call it truly special.
<string>When my own inevitable end comes, I suspect I'll<lf>be thinking back to those days.
<string>I'm grateful to Rex and Cobb. Their skills enabled<lf>us to overcome this latest trial.
<string>We will need to continue our study of the<lf>Dragontorch and all that's happened since.
<string>Especially now that we've begun to glimpse what<lf>that thing truly is—if only half by coincidence.
<string>An extinct species that managed to claw itself<lf>back from the abyss...
<string>No. If it has successfully reproduced, then it's<lf>no more extinct than you or I.
<string>Symptoms of the Frenzy traveled up the food chain<lf>to Arkveld through a process of bioconcentration...
<string>A bold and compelling theory, while also logically sound.<lf>I have to say, it's very Erik.
<string>I look forward to the investigation results.
<string>Gemma never changes, eh? She's certainly grown<lf>into a dependable woman, though.
<string>There's a long list of people I'm eager to regale<lf>with tales of her triumphs. They'll be overjoyed.
<string>It feels as though I first met Gemma<lf>half an age ago. She was only a pup.
<string>I remember her staring, enthralled by the gear<lf>of a friend of mine. A gunner, Nadia.
<string>Little Gemma was glued to her side.
<string>Our visit to these lands is just one tiny moment<lf>in the long span of its history.
<string>Best we remembered that, and let it guide the way<lf>we conduct ourselves.
<string>Hunter, handler, and support team... It's always<lf>stunning to watch an efficient machine at work.
<string>What a profound relief to see so much evidence<lf>that my involvement isn't necessary.
