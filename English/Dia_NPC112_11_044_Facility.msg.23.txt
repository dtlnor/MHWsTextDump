<string>Oh, hello there traveler. You're looking well.

<string>How's it going?

<string>As you can see, I have my hands full.
<string>I've got cheese and children to mind, and I can't<lf>take my eyes off either.
<string>I make this cheese for everyone.<lf>And no, "samples" are not allowed.
<string>I was taught that nature has her fangs, and that<lf>our part is to accept whatever comes.
<string>But it seems you see the world<lf>a little differently.
<string>I'm teaching the young ones how to make cheese.
<string>I hope they come to actually enjoy the process.
<string>I am always shocked to see how your path leads<lf>you to act. It's so different from our lives here.
<string>Have you tried the cheese we make here yet?
<string>Tasty, isn't it? One of our most popular exports,<lf>I'll have you know.
<string>I've told my kids a thousand times not to go<lf>sneaking bites of the cheese.
<string>But then not even five minutes later, they're at<lf>it again! Maybe it's <ITALIC>too</ITALIC> good.
<string>Do you enjoy this journey of yours?<lf>It's not too hard?
<string>I suppose we all deal with our share of hardships<lf>though. People are good at adapting.
<string>Thinking back, I don't think I've ever taken life<lf>this seriously before...
<string>But I figure we have no guarantee on tomorrow.<lf>We have to learn to accept whatever comes.
<string>Accept and adapt.
<string>I'm sorry, dear, I'm a bit busy. The Sandtide is<lf>coming, you know.
<string>The sand leviathans get even more rambunctious<lf>during the Sandtide.
<string>Phew... We're alive. It's all thanks to you. We are<lf>all so grateful.
<string>There's a lot more work to be done now, and busy<lf>folk are hungry folk. Cheese won't make itself!
<string>Would you mind if I asked for your help now and<lf>again? You're always free to say no, of course.
<string>First things first, a clean workspace makes<lf>a clean mind.
<string>Tell me if I have this wrong, but...
<string>Did you just go solve all our problems while we<lf>just panicked about the Sandtide?
<string>My kids keep begging me to let them go play<lf>outside the village.
<string>It's been ages since we had a Plenty this nice, so I'm<lf>all for letting them get some fresh air.

<string>Zatoh's looked so stressed recently, the poor dear.
<string>He won't tell me what's on his mind, though.
<string><COLOR FF0000>#Rejected#</COLOR> Dia_NPC112_11_044_Facility_066_t03
<string>Little kids are always so earnest. There's no need<lf>to cry over a little cheese-making mistake.
<string>...Or wait, do you think they're just scared<lf>of me?
<string>I suppose I do give my own little ones an earful when<lf>they're out of line.
<string>Children get bigger by the day.<lf>I notice it with my own kids, too...
<string>But Nata's really a shock. He's a whole different<lf>person from the first time he came here.

<string>Between the Doshaguma attack and everything else,<lf>we've been through a lot lately, huh?
<string>It's easy to laugh it all off now, but that's only<lf>because nobody died, thank goodness.
<string>We have you to thank for that.

<string>Cheese and thank you.
<string>This will see gouda use. Thank you.
<string>If you need me, I'm here.
<string>Another time, then.
<string>It's always appreciated.
<string>With so much happening recently,<lf>work has really started to pile up.
<string>I've been left with lots of things I still need...
<string>Say, mind if I asked for your help now and<lf>again? You're always free to say no, of course.
<string>Today's trade is a cut above.
