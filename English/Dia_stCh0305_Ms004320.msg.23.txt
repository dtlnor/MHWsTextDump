<string>Synthetic? You're kidding.
<string>If it turns out to be true, that's a bombshell.
<string>It's not like it's never been talked about before—<lf>the possibility of creating new species, but...
<string>That's why we need to find a way to Suja,<lf>to find out as much as we can.
<string>Well in that case, perhaps we should contact<lf>the local expert.
<string>We bumped into a very "verbose" Wudwud<lf>while investigating the Cliffs.
<string>Think I know the one.
<string>Alright, I'll take you to where he is.
<string>That'd be great. You ready to go?
<string>Werner and I will stay put.
<string>The greatbridge up ahead should get us to<lf>his hidey-hole all the quicker.
<string>So there's an ancient city, synthetic species, and<lf>someone called the Allhearken... Am I keeping up?
<string>I'd never heard of <ITALIC>any</ITALIC> of this before.
<string>Then I'm sure your head is spinning as much as mine.
<string>We'll bear right once we're across the bridge.
<string>We should keep to the left.
<string>We'll find the Wudwud's hiding place higher up.
<string>We'll find the Wudwud's hiding place down below.
<string>So this is what it's like on the inside.
<string>Alma! Look at those arches!
<string>We're seeing the remnants of a civilization at its prime.
<string>Time really is just a straight line, huh?
<string>Just a line of infinitesimal moments leading to the present.
<string>We should press on to Rove's hiding place.
<string>We should speak to Rove...
<string>Well, what's this? How capricious our meetings<lf>and partings seem to be.
<string>You need not explain... I assume you have traveled<lf>here to seek my wisdom?
<string>That's right! How did you know?
<string>We need to reach a village called Suja.<lf>Do you know of a way there?
<string>Hmm... What paths may be are limited only by our minds.
<string>I know of a path paved in air, grouted with risk,<lf>and patrolled by a goliath. What say you?
<string>Come to think of it, Tasheen did mention<lf>a "giant monster."
<string>It's a risk we have to take.<lf>Can we count on you, Rove?
<string>You may.
<string>Go! Don't stop, no matter what!
<string>Show us your mettle!
<string>I thought "paved in air" was just a metaphor!
<string>You can do this, Gemma!
<string>Whoa! It's huge!
<string>It's right on us! Watch out!
<string>Where'd it go?
<string>Whoa, stop!
<string>That was close.
<string>Let's keep going.
<string>I don't like all these tremors...
<string>The sheer size of it is a threat...
<string>That place covered in icicles...<lf>It looks spacious enough.
<string>We might be able to set up a Pop-up Camp.
<string>It's worth a try. Anything's better than staying<lf>out here.
<string>Is everyone all right? That thing scares the wits<lf>out of me.
<string>We can't go any further while it's around.<lf>Hunter, I believe this is where we excel?
<string>Right. Alma, Gemma, Nata, you stay here.
<string>We'll get the camp set up in no time.
<string>All we have to do is drive it off.<lf>That'll guarantee everyone safe passage.
<string>OK, but promise you'll be careful!
<string>Heh, you have nothing to fear. Let's go!
<string>Right!
<string>I've seen precarious spots like this before, but "seeing"<lf>and "crossing yourself" are different beasts.
<string>I'm sorry, it's... I'm still trying to wrap my<lf>head around it. How can a creature be that <ITALIC>big?</ITALIC>
<string>You really are amazing, Hunter! The way you faced<lf>something like that!
<string>You're so cool!
<string>It's strange. The look on your face lacks any<lf>sign of terror.
<string>You really do live up to the rumors.<lf>Honestly, you surpass them.
<string>Did you see that? That monster freezes the area<lf>around its feet.
<string>It crosses unstable ground by adhering itself to<lf>it. We'll need a way of mitigating that cold.
<string>You needn't worry about me. Keeping Nata and the<lf>others safe is our priority.
<string>With a creature this size, let's do it by the book.<lf>Go for the head and forelegs first.
<string>Let's do this. If anyone's got my back,<lf>I know it's you.
<string>Yes! It's working! You're doing great!
<string>Now that's how it's done! Guess you've danced with giant monsters before, huh?
<string>Keep whittling its health down!<lf>It'll give up soon!
<string>Any moment now... Don't think about if,<lf>don't think about when... Just keep attacking!
<string>It's down! Now it'll be easier to target those<lf>ridges on its back!
<string>Got it! Did you see any other ridges like that one?<lf>They might be equally susceptible!
<string>These ridges must be its weakness!
<string>Maybe it uses those ridges to manipulate<lf>the air's temperature.
<string>Good, now you can attack its back directly!
<string>Well done! Now we've got it where we want it!
<string>A path of rocks, huh? Let's pursue it by Seikret!
<string>There! A way forward! Let's go after it!
<string>You alright? Don't go out there unless<lf>ya got some kind of ice protection, OK?
<string>We should reconsider your loadout.<lf>I'm here if you need any help with your gear.
<string>You can accept the Quest at the Quest Counter.<lf>Prepare well before taking it on.
