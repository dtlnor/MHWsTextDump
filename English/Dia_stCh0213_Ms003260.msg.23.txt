<string>Hope you're ready cuz we're<lf>gonna kick your tail!
<string>Waaaah! There's the flame part!
<string>We'll make sushi out of you yet!
<string>Next time, try targeting the tentacles!<lf>You might be able to cut them off!
<string>We did it! I hope everyone in Azuz is OK!
<string>I'm sure Gemma and the others have<lf>it under control.
<string>Let's head back.
<string>Thank you, travelers, for everything you have done.
<string>All of Azuz's tribes owe you our lives and livelihoods.
<string>What do you intend to do next?
<string>We need to share our findings.
<string>Has the Firespring ever broken its cycle before?
<string>What is the Black Flame?
<string>(End Conversation)
<string>We'll begin by returning to the Plains Base Camp.
<string>We have to share our findings with our colleagues.
<string>Really? But the season of Plenty is just starting! Surely<lf>there's no harm in staying a little longer and enjoying it?
<string>It's not the worst idea I've heard.
<string>It was arrogant to think we could harness<lf>the Firespring's power anytime we want.
<string>Turns out too much of a good thing can<lf>be a bad thing.
<string>Was that the first time the Firespring ever broke<lf>its cycle?
<string>Yes. Werner explained that our seasons are produced<lf>by some artificial mechanism—not sure I believe it.
<string>Everything we consider nature isn't natural?<lf>We're gonna need some time with that one.
<string>Werner was just trying to make things better<lf>for us. We won't hold it against him.
<string>Chief Yabran, you mentioned hearing stories<lf>about the Black Flame when you were a boy.
<string>Yes. I pored over some old tomes and finally<lf>found what I believe might be its name.
<string>It is called Nu Udra.
<string>The apex predator of this region...
<string>All units of the expedition will be converging<lf>at the Windward Plains Base Camp.
<string>Rosso from the Rubrum Unit is requesting our support.<lf>We should find him at our earliest opportunity.
