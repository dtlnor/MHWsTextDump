<string>The Allhearken is not the only special personage<lf>residing here in Suja.
<string>As with the Allhearken, I feel what matters is how<lf>one uses nature's gifts,
<string>and how one gives back to nature in the end.<lf>That is the challenge we all face.
<string>You. You, there. Whence do you think come the<lf>whispers the Allhearken hears?
<string>I feel they must be all around us, plenty and<lf>more, and all the time.
<string>And from the cradle to the grave, the Allhearken<lf>bends her ear, plucking them from silence.
<string>You seem in high spirits today.
<string>Me, I've lived this life for many long years.<lf>But that human lad...
<string>It never becomes any easier to see pain like that<lf>upon such a small face.
<string>I would reach out, but what use has he for an old<lf>Wyverian's words?
<string>You, too, trusted in yourself and gave your all.<lf>I've naught more to say.
<string>Tell me, how does the young lad fare?
<string>So, his name is Nata. I see. I see...
<string>Wounded Hollow has long been a nexus where<lf>monsters often crossed.
<string>I suppose all change to the lands' ecosystems<lf>in turn affect such gathering places.
<string>All you ought to concern yourself with is pressing<lf>ahead together with your fellows.
<string>I don't advise you to simply drift along as life's<lf>passenger, but...
<string>Heh heh heh... Fellows to share your path are<lf>a treasure indeed.
<string>Nata seems so very alive as of late.<lf>A welcome sight.
<string>He has slipped the Keepers' chains. Perhaps even<lf>found for himself a new way of living.
<string>Those Seikret you well know are mankind's<lf>longtime friends.
<string>A <ITALIC>long</ITALIC> time... Back when monsters were downed by<lf>thunder, their parts were ported by Seikret.
<string>A time so far removed that none who witnessed<lf>it remain.
<string>None who witnessed Wyveria's fall remain today.<lf>None save the Guardians, I suppose.
<string>Word of those times has passed down through<lf>generations of Allhearken unto today.
<string>The stories feel to us like the events<lf>of only yesterday.
