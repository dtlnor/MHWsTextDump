<string>So uh, I'm confused. Why did Arkveld come here?
<string>Obviously—
<string>Uh, good question.
<string>This is where the Dragontorch is supposed to be, right?
<string>We already know that Arkveld was drawn to powerful<lf>sources of elemental energy it could harvest.
<string>And this was the mother lode?
<string>Maybe, despite feeding, it still had<lf>impulses as a Guardian.
<string>Either way, I guess we'll never know.
<string>Wyveria's energy source...
<string>In a way, it's the very heart of this land's ecosystem.
<string>I want to go to the "Dragontorch."
<string>It's the last piece of the puzzle.<lf>What Arkveld was after. I need to know.
<string>Let's look for a way forward.
<string>Look...
<string>That's gotta be it, right?
<string>But something's taken it over...
<string>It can't be...
<string>A Guardian...?
