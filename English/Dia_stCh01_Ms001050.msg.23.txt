<string>Well, here we are. Home sweet home-away-from-home.
<string>It's too bad they didn't let us in the village.
<string>Yeah, but I guess they have their reasons... For now,<lf>let's worry about getting this honey to Provisions.
<string><COLOR FF0000>#Rejected#</COLOR> Dia_stCh01_Ms001050_0010_t004
<string>With all the new personnel showing up,<lf>this honey could really make a difference.
<string>Good idea.
<string>Now's not the time for detours.
<string>Hey there. What can I do for ya?
<string>A little bird told me you needed some honey.
<string>Did you bring me some? Sweet deal!
<string>Honey is the sticky secret to our healing potions.<lf>You're literally a lifesaver. This is for your trouble.
<string>And since the Support Team STILL hasn't gotten<lf>here yet, I was really startin' to sweat.
<string>Speaking of, where ARE those furry transporters?<lf>They should have been here by now.
<string>Either way, can I interest you in something?
<string>Yo, Hunter! Come over here.<lf>I need to talk to you for a sec.
<string>I've got some materials you can use. How 'bout you<lf>put 'em to good use and upgrade that weapon of yours?

<string>Oh, by the way, Alma was looking for you.
<string>You can find more of this stuff from deposits<lf>pokin' up out of the ground.
<string>They're loaded with all kinds of goodies I can use<lf>to upgrade your gear. And you're gonna need it!
<string>We have no idea what's out here, so it's best<lf>to be prepared. Carry a big stick, as they say!
<string>So if you need anything, you know where to find me.
<string>What do you think happened to the Support Team?
<string>They should have been here by now.
<string>Are they in trouble?
<string>Hey, over here!
<string>Can I talk to you right quick?
<string>What's up?
<string><COLOR FF0000>#Rejected#</COLOR> Dia_stCh01_Ms001050_0045_t002bc_
<string>It'll have to wait.
<string>OK. I'll be here.
<string>It's about the Support Team. They should<lf>have been here by now.
<string>I mapped out what their route ought to be.<lf>From the desert, they'd enter the grasslands and—
<string>
<string>An SOS Flare! You don't think...?
<string><COLOR FF0000>#Rejected#</COLOR> Dia_stCh01_Ms001050_0050_t005
<string>Come on!
<string>Follow the scoutflies!
<string>Be careful out there, Hunter!
<string>The timing, the direction—it must be them!
<string>Hurry!
<string>Move those hindquarters!
<string>The Support Team must be in trouble!
<string>Hold on everyone, I'm-a comin' to help!
<string>The flare came from over there!
<string>Sorry, but I can't let you in.
<string>I'm really sorry, traveler.
<string>There they are!
<string>The Guild authorizes you to hunt that Quematrice<lf>and protect the Support Team!
<string>We should focus on that Quematrice!
<string>Now that the Quematrice has us marked,<lf>Base Camp is at risk.
<string>The Guild authorizes you to hunt it down<lf>to ensure the expedition's safety.
<string>You alright? Maybe you should take a look at<lf>your equipment before heading back out there.
<string>That's what you get for messing with my partner!<lf>AND with me!
<string>Great work, Hunter! Oh, and the Support Team<lf>made it to Base Camp safely!
<string>Great. Let's head back.
<string>Thanks, Y'sai! You saved everyone!
<string>Can I ask why you came back?
<string>I thought you might need these Seikret.<lf>You'll look after them, won't you?
<string>Are you sure? We don't want to burden your village...
<string>They belong with you. I've never met<lf>more capable and deserving riders.
<string>And I had Gemma make you a new saddle.
<string>I sure did. Even added a holster so you can<lf>carry an additional weapon.
<string>That'll come in handy.
<string>And one more thing...I was wondering<lf>if you'd like to visit my home.
<string>Since Zatoh is out, my grandmother told me now<lf>would be a great time to pay back the favor I owe.
<string>We'd love to! Thank you.
<string>Great! I'll be waiting until you're ready to go.
<string><COLOR FF0000>#Rejected#</COLOR> Dia_stCh01_Ms001050_0120_t013
<string>Oh! By the way, everyone's been asking about you.
<string><COLOR FF0000>#Rejected#</COLOR> Dia_stCh01_Ms001050_0120_t015
<string>Oh, it's you. Did asking around the village turn<lf>up anything? ...I see. That's a shame.
<string>Well, for now, we just need to focus on doing what<lf>we can, one thing at a time.
<string>A Seikret, huh? Fascinating. I'd love a look at<lf>the way they're raised in the village.
<string><ITALIC>What!?</ITALIC> You left the Seikret there? No, I guess that<lf>makes sense... Should've taken a better look before.
<string>The Support Team still hasn't arrived?<lf>Huh... Right.
<string>Mm? "Didn't I hear about it earlier?" ...Did I?
<string>The Support Team...
