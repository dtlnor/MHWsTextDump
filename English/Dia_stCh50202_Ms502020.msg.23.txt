<string>Hail, fisherfellow! Are they biting today?
<string>Say no more! It's in your eyes. Here—a gift from<lf>one rod-wrangler to another: a lure.
<string>Lures will attract some fish, while others give it<lf>the cold fin. It's all about knowing your mark.
<string>The lure I gave you excels at hooking Goldenfish.<lf>Don't try to hide it. You're curious. Eager.
<string>A bit.
<string>Goldenfish favor dark pools, away from the light<lf>of the sun. Seek them underground.
<string>Now, away with you, fisherfellow! Away, and may<lf>your line grow heavy!
<string>Welcome back. Ahh, a fine catch, fisherfellow!<lf>Quite the Goldenfish.
<string>Did you know, friend, that Goldenfish sell for<lf>nearly as much as their namesake?
<string>They may not serve much other use, but you'll get<lf>a fine price for it at the provisioner's.
<string>Getting good use of your catch is as much the joy<lf>of fishing as hooking them in the first place.
<string>For each purpose, a fish, and for each fish, a<lf>lure. Ooh, that sounded positively wise!
<string>Goldenfish thrive in gloomy spots. You're better<lf>off looking for them away from direct sunlight.
<string>...Ironic, considering how sparkly they are.
