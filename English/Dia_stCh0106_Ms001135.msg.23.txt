<string>Zatoh. Just who I was looking for.
<string>Y'sai here says that a pack of Doshaguma<lf>is closing in on the village.
<string>Please, Elder, you have to believe them!<lf>Everyone must seek shelter!
<string>Nonsense. The sound of the gemchimes is,<lf>and always has been, the only shelter we need.
<string>Elder, with my own eyes, I watched these people<lf>stand against the sand leviathans unafraid.
<string>They wield powerful tools and knowledge of monsters<lf>far greater than our own. They deserve our trust.
<string>For the winds' sake, please, please give the order<lf>for our people to shelter.
<string>Hmm...very well, Zatoh. If you are that certain.
<string>There!
<string>The pack is leaving!
<string>Ah!
<string>Let's follow the pack!
<string>Let's go!
<string>If we take the overhead route, we might be able to<lf>get ahead of the pack.
<string>The Seikret will take it from here.
<string>We're counting on you.
<string>Just look at 'em all!
<string>They seem pretty riled-up.
<string>Hey, do you see that rock?
<string>Yeah. Let's give 'em a headache.
<string>Got 'em! But the pack's still going strong.
<string>Don't lose them!
<string>The one that's larger than the rest is their alpha.
<string>If we take down the alpha, the pack should disperse.
<string>I'll try provoking it with an attack.
<string>Attack the alpha and get its attention!
<string>Attack the alpha!
<string>Oh, it's REAL angry now!
<string>Now, to lead it away from the pack!<lf>We'll make for the desert!
<string>Right!
<string>We gotta hurry! Attack the alpha!
<string>They're right on our tails!
<string>The sandstorm!
<string>I can't see!
<string>The Guild authorizes you to hunt the Alpha<lf>Doshaguma and restore peace to Kunafa Village!
<string>I'm impressed you managed to pull that whole pack<lf>out of the village, Hunter.
<string>Watching you guys work never gets old. Now,<lf>let's stay focused and get this done.
<string>I'll be watching close, Hunter. I won't miss any<lf>of what you do.
<string>The sandstorm...
<string>Are you OK? That alpha sure packs a punch...
<string>And as long as it lives, those Doshaguma are going<lf>to attack the village relentlessly.
<string>Once you're ready, please resume the hunt.
<string>Hey, are you all right?
<string>That alpha is as dangerous as they get... Once<lf>you're prepped, head back out and finish the hunt.
<string>Nice work, Hunter! You did it!
<string>Nobody messes with my partner!
<string>Now that the pack has dispersed,<lf>we should return to Kunafa.
<string>Oh wow. The landscape is so...lush.
<string>There's something in that tree over there.
<string>Didn't we see those birds in the forest?<lf>And now they're nesting here.
<string>You can see so far now.
<string>The Wind's Gasp is a breathtaking sight<lf>no matter how many times I look at it.
<string>Something about it just grabs me.
<string>I see the Dalthydons have new mini-sized additions<lf>to their herd.
<string>Aww, it's a baby.
<string>There's the villagers!
<string>Oh good, the livestock's safe!
<string>Hey there!
<string>You've returned!
<string>I'm so glad you're safe.
<string>Y'sai and the others must be worried sick.
<string>I'm sure Nata's worried sick about you, too.
<string>We made it.
<string>It's great to be back!
<string>Welcome back, friend!
<string>The Elder and Zatoh told us everything.
<string>Are you hurt? Do you need anything?
<string>Nice to cross one problem off the list.
<string>Speaking of which, Nata, did you and Astrum<lf>Unit have any luck with your investigation?
<string>Uh-huh. We found this place deep in the forest with<lf>lots of water, and nearby were some drag marks.
<string>I remember that the White Wraith had something<lf>dragging from its arms.
<string>So maybe it's what left those marks.
<string>Yeah... You might just be on to something.
<string>I think we should travel to the Forest Base Camp<lf>together. Better safe than sorry.

<string>Let's go, we've got Seikret to deliver.
<string>Let me know when you're ready to go.<lf>I'll be waiting for you at the Plains Base Camp.
