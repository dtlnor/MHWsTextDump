<string>Yeah?
<string>Excellent choice. Your weapon, that is.
<string>Yeah, what?
<string>Excellent choice. Your weapon, that is.<lf>...Did I already mention that?
<string>Olivia can do her thing.<lf>Just like <ITALIC>I'll</ITALIC> do <ITALIC>mine</ITALIC>.
<string>These lands are way, way more<lf>fascinating than you think.
<string>But will I meet the World's Maker? Maybe not.<lf>That long search of mine still has a ways to go.
<string>Yeah, what?
<string>An undiscovered monster?<lf>You don't say.
<string>Sounds like we'll be heading to the cliffs...
<string>Something about us busting our butts so the rest<lf>of you all have a Base Camp to work out of.
<string>Leave it to Olivia to rope us into this stuff.
<string>Yeah, what?
<string>The Keepers... They're sitting<lf>on a whole mountain of mysteries.
<string>I'm in the middle of something here—<lf>be a pal and go bug someone else.
<string>I wish there was a way to get buddy-buddy with<lf>the White Wraith so I could examine it up close.
<string>Just imagine—the Keepers' ancestors had a way of<lf><ITALIC>doing</ITALIC> that.
<string>What I wouldn't give to turn back time and see<lf>it for myself.
<string>Like to think I've begun to grasp Wyvern Milk a<lf>bit, but its purest form's the Dragontorch. Hmm...
<string>Isn't it about time they let me take a proper look<lf>at the kid's pendant?
<string>He's a Guild apprentice now—doesn't it follow<lf>that he'd cooperate with our analysis?
<string>...No? Eh, I can wait.
<string>Filing reports with the Guild can wait. I don't<lf>want to miss a second of this.
<string>What? You bored?
<string>I figured we'd see some motion out here, too.
<string>Not what I expected, but I'll take it.
<string>I guess the effects of the energy flowing out of<lf>here have wound their way back.
<string>I'll do what I want here. I'm sure Erik's doing<lf>the same.
<string>Oh, it's you guys. Chitchat is Olivia's job—go<lf>and see her.
<string>Seems like the Dragontorch is having another hell<lf>of a day...
<string>What's got this thing so bent out of shape? I'm<lf>nicer to it than anybody.
<string>Sorry, I need more time. Too much to think about.
<string>Gore Magala, huh? Sorry, that's not really my<lf>area. But you knew that.
<string>I told you before. This excess output's a reaction.
<string>It's always the quiet ones that fly off the handle.<lf>What's got you riled, Dragontorch?
<string>Sounds like Sir Fabius is back. I'd get moving,<lf>unless you like getting chewed out.
<string>A cure? You people make it sound so easy.
<string>I'll make it happen, though. Finally starting to<lf>get my head around the Dragontorch.
<string>I'm still not sure how to get the reins around<lf>this rush I'm feeling.
<string>Not you, huh? No skin off my back. My feelings<lf>are my own.
<string>Probably goes without saying, but I've completely<lf>scrapped my old approach to the Dragontorch.
<string>Bit rough going back to square one, but there's a<lf>light at the end of the tunnel now.
<string>That kid's fired up as ever, huh?
<string>So it's a sure thing now? Arkveld's out there,<lf>reproducing?
<string>That's good news in my book. Another worthwhile<lf>investigation.
<string>Thing's elemental energy absorption and conversion<lf>is off the charts. Speed and efficiency both.
<string>Feel like I've waited long enough. It's just a<lf>pendant. I'm only asking for a quick look at it.
<string>It'd be a big help if you could try to urge him<lf>along with it, too. No can do, you say? Hmph. I see.
<string>Yeah, hey, can it wait? I'm kinda busy upstairs<lf>right now, if you don't mind.
<string>Come to think of it, how's Erik? All good?
<string>What? I figured it wouldn't kill me to be a little<lf>thoughtful.

<string>The Dragontorch, the Guardians, and Zoh Shia...<lf>What a well-made system.
<string>Despite how hard they tried to fight,<lf>Wyveria still ended up the way it is today.
<string>Or perhaps this was the balancing of nature...
