<string>Hey!
<string>Over here!
<string>Over here, Hunter.
<string>Your reputation precedes you, Hunter.
<string>I trust you know what I've called you<lf>here to discuss?
<string>Yes, sir. The Forbidden Lands?
<string>Indeed. But more precisely, about the<lf>boy we rescued in the vicinity...
<string>Entry to the region itself has been restricted for a<lf>thousand years. We thought it completely uninhabited.
<string>Any remnants of its ancient civilization<lf>rest solely in historical record.
<string>Now imagine our surprise...to have discovered this boy.
<string>He claims to be part of a clan, "The Keepers." He said they have<lf>a village...in a land we thought uninhabited for ages.
<string>A few years have passed, but the Academy,<lf>of course, has remained skeptical.
<string>This village... Is there evidence it exists?
<string>Nothing absolute.
<string>But the mysterious composition of the boy's<lf>pendant suggests it might.
<string>And as for how we came to rescue the boy...
<string>Sir?
<string>It seems a certain monster had forced him to flee.<lf>It attacked his village, and he escaped alone.
<string>Unfortunately, the underground tunnel he used to make his<lf>escape collapsed. We found him, took him in...and here we are.
<string>Do we know the status of the village?
<string>Unknown.
<string>And of the monster?
<string>Unknown.
<string>However, the scholars hypothesize that it may be a monster...<lf>which we thought to have perished long ago.
<string>An extinct species...?
<string>They're calling it the White Wraith. The Guild has authorized the rescue<lf>of the Keepers and an investigation into this monster.
<string>I've selected you as a lead hunter for this expedition.
<string>Thank you, sir.
<string>Finding the village won't be easy.<lf>You'll need the proper guide.
<string>Speaking of which, I have an extra assignment for you.
<string>Hello, my name is Alma.
<string>Come on. It's OK.
<string>As soon as we find a good spot, we can<lf>get things set up and ready to go!
<string>And then we can get started!
<string>This is gonna be great!
<string>I hope we find them soon.
<string>Look!
<string>Hard to port!
<string>There's so many...
<string>They're exceptionally agitated...<lf>Could they be chasing something?
<string>It's a person!
<string>Bring us closer!
<string>And crash right into them!?
<string>We're still too far away!
<string>Then what do we do?
<string>Hold on... What's that?
<string>That's our ride.
<string>Can you reach it?
<string>I have to try.
<string>I'm coming, too!
<string>Booyah! Nice!
