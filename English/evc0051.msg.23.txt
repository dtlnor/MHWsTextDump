<string>Nata!
<string>Alma! Hunter!
<string>Is...
<string>Is it true?
<string>Come on.
<string>It's Arkveld's...
<string>The will to live always finds a way.
<string>From one generation, to the next.
<string>(bird fluttering)
<string>So they found the Keepers' village...
<string>And unraveled the mystery of the White Wraith.
<string>They even managed to see the boy home safe.<lf>Truly impressive.
<string>However, to learn that it was artificial life...
<string>The Guardian Arkveld scoured the land for<lf>a more lucrative energy source.
<string>By absorbing the properties of those sources,<lf>it was able to achieve a higher state of living.
<string>Unfortunately, after learning predation it became<lf>unable to control its intake of Wyvern Milk.
<string>Intoxicated by the surplus of energy,<lf>it descended into madness...
<string>These were the findings of the expedition.
<string>Yes, sir.
<string>But this report has just come in.
<string>Wyveria's ultimate Guardian, Zoh Shia, awoke from<lf>its resting place...
<string>It fed off the Dragontorch, the heart of the<lf>Forbidden Lands' ecosystem, to evolve itself...
<string>And by doing so, threw the weather of the<lf>surrounding regions into disarray.
<string>Cognizant of the longterm repercussions,
<string>Avis Unit made the agonizing decision to put<lf>Zoh Shia to rest.
<string>A life-altering end.
<string>Just as Alma said...that Hunter is something else.
<string>Sir, if I may.
<string>Why do you think the people of Wyveria created<lf>the Guardians?
<string>For what purpose would they endanger themselves<lf>with monsters like Zoh Shia?
<string>I dare not dishonor them with conjecture.
<string>The details require finesse, but it seems the door is<lf>open to diplomatic overtures between East and West...
<string>The Guild, I know, is eager to open communications<lf>with the Forbidden Lands...
<string>No...
<string>We will hold off. Should that branch be<lf>extended, it must be from them.
<string>More importantly, this...Dragontorch, was it?
<string>Uncontrollable energy...
<string>...upon which an entire ecosystem depends.
<string>They intend to continue their research<lf>on it, and the artificial monsters.
<string>While it's safe for now, the Dragontorch and<lf>Guardians are in a precarious balance.
<string>There are worries surrounding its artificial nature.
<string>My take is this: Both mankind and their creations<lf>play a role in the ecosystem.
<string>If nothing else, nature will always surpass<lf>humanity's expectations.
<string>This expedition was not seen through without flaw.
<string>But...
<string>So long as there are hunters,
<string>we can handle whatever may come.
