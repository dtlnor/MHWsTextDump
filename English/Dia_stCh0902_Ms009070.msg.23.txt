<string>Is this area still experiencing weather anomalies<lf>like the others?
<string>Let's survey the area. ...Unless there were<lf>some quests you wanted to prioritize?
<string>Let's head out.
<string>I need a bit longer to prepare.
<string>(End Conversation)
<string>Understood. Let's commence our investigation.
<string>It must be a struggle for the people here to go<lf>about their daily lives amid this sandstorm...
<string>True. We should go check up on the village.
<string>Mm? Where is everyone?
<string>Is that... It's Y'sai and Zatoh! Let's go talk<lf>to them.
<string>Greetings! Didn't expect to see you here,<lf>especially now!
<string>That's just it. We were concerned about the<lf>village.
<string>Are those Doshaguma tracks you were looking at?
<string>That is right. I would ask you to listen to what I<lf>have to say. Please, come inside.
<string>Then Doshaguma have come to the village again?
<string>Don't worry. Everyone was evacuated,<lf>so no one came to harm.
<string>I'm relieved to hear it. But, judging by the look<lf>of things, that isn't the whole story here.
<string>Indeed. We have never experienced<lf>the Sandtide for so long.
<string>We were redoubling our patrols as a result, and...<lf>We sighted a Rey Dau on a plateau not far out.
<string>Given the circumstances, I'm guessing<lf>it was pretty riled up?
<string>You grasp its nature well. Just so. Even from<lf>afar, its fury was clear to see.
<string>It was terrifying... So we evacuated the village<lf>before anything happened.
<string>Smart. It's likely the Doshaguma were driven<lf>out of their own territory and came here.
<string>Which means that until that Rey Dau is dealt<lf>with, the village will remain in danger...

<string>Right. We should get going ASAP.
<string>I am grateful. We will continue to watch<lf>this area to ensure no one was left behind.
<string>We'll be all right here, but you be careful out there!
<string>The plateau that he spoke of is over that way.
<string>Alright. Let's have a look.
<string>I tried staying at the village with Zatoh, but...<lf>I was a nervous wreck until just now.
<string>I'll be honest, I'm <ITALIC>really</ITALIC> glad to see you all.
<string>Don't sell your bravery short. So, the others all<lf>made it somewhere safe?
<string>Yes. We told them to stay there until Zatoh or I<lf>can make sure it's safe.
<string>Alright. Keep up the watch, but don't be<lf>reckless.
<string>Did the evacuation go smoothly? It couldn't have<lf>been easy, in this weather.
<string>We managed. We have the Doshaguma incident to<lf>thank for that in part.
<string>After that, we came together to form a plan for<lf>emergencies. That prepared us for this.
<string>Very prudent. I'm glad to hear it. I'll do all I<lf>can to get your people back home soon.
<string>We are sorry to trouble you. All Kunafa thanks<lf>you.
<string>...It's close.
<string>I feel it, too. It was enraged to the point Zatoh<lf>and Y'sai could tell from afar. Let's be careful.
<string>Target spotted. Excessive agitation confirmed—<lf>Rey Dau hunt authorized!
<string>Let's make it safe for the villagers to return home!
<string>Understood!
<string>When you're ready, accept the quest<lf>to continue the investigation.
<string>Excellent work.
<string>Hopefully this will keep any further monsters<lf>from being driven towards the village.
<string>Right. Let's head back and report.
<string>On behalf of my people, I thank you for<lf>this kindness.
<string>We are truly grateful.
<string>We can't take all the credit; it was your swift<lf>action that led your people to safety.
<string>Well, we learned it from you.
<string>Yes. That we must better understand the monsters<lf>we share this land with, and to prepare ourselves.
<string>Quite right. Perhaps that is the shape of harmony,<lf>as best we can attain it.
<string><COLOR FF0000>#Rejected#</COLOR> Dia_stCh0902_Ms009070_0150_t007
<string>Still, the long Fallow now gives way to a Sandtide<lf>unabating... Is it some ill omen?
<string>Our friends are investigating the cause now, but<lf>I'm afraid we still don't fully understand it.
<string>I see. The storm has always given way to new life.<lf>...Perhaps we have come to take that for granted.
<string>I will continue to be vigilant here.
<string>Me, too. Please, you all go and do what you must.
<string>Yes. You need not worry about us here. May the<lf>winds guide your travels.
<string>Thank you, and take care.
