<string>Oh, Hunter. Got a minute?
<string>So, with Zoh Shia gone and the whole ecosystem<lf>going crazy now, monsters are getting tougher.
<string>Good news for us, that means we're getting in<lf>higher quality materials. So let's put 'em to use!
<string>You're certainly fired up.
<string>Hah! Like a forge at full throttle!
<string>Anyway, I've got something I want to try out.
<string>Thing is, I'm short on the materials I need.<lf>You mind helping me out?
<string>Happy to. I'll report back once I've got them.
<string>Thanks! No hurry, just let me know whenever.
<string>Perfect, this is the stuff!
<string>Heh, sit tight just a second!
<string>Here! I made what you brought me into a pendant.<lf>Try decking out your weapon with it. Fun, right?
<string>Oh, and I only used a scrap from those materials.<lf>Let me give you back the rest so you can use 'em.
<string>Don't be a stranger, yeah? Anytime you need some<lf>new gear, you come see me!
<string>Will do. Thanks for all your help.
