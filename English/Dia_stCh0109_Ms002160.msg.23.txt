<string>Hey, we should stick together.
<string>Are you gonna just wander off, or...?
<string>Shouldn't we stay together...?
<string>The White Wraith is an unknown, save that it<lf>struck a human village.
<string>All life may be equal in this ecosystem, but I'm a<lf>human. For humans' sake, I need to follow it.
<string>I'll leave these Wudwuds to you.
<string>We'll follow up on sighting reports of the White<lf>Wraith on our end.
<string>These Seikret... You can see the intelligence in<lf>their eyes.
<string>What do you think? Can you trust me to cover your<lf>back? ...Hm, I'm glad to hear it.
<string>You and I are bound to race across beautiful lands.
<string>Good boy. Thanks for all your help on the last<lf>hunt. I'll be counting on you next time, too.
<string>They said they're willing to part with<lf>our Seikret. A most generous offer.
<string>I will strive to get along well with our Seikret.<lf>Heh... A simple task.
<string>Welcome <ITALIC>officially</ITALIC> aboard, Seikret. My name is<lf>Athos. Livvie's companion.
<string>Viewed like this, it's certainly quite large...
<string>The White Wraith felled the leviathan in some<lf>way that didn't involve any physical blow.
<string>Hmmm, but why would it have<lf>felt the need to do it?
<string>Ahh, I wish I could have another look at the<lf>White Wraith's behaviors...
<string>Now I just need Olivia not to go silent on me.
<string>You guys be careful, too.
<string>I heard from Erik. The White Wraith did something<lf>to that leviathan and it keeled over dead?
<string>Hmph... Living creatures aren't my field and I<lf>don't much care, but I do know this—
<string>Every moving machine's got a power source. Lose<lf>that source, and—whatever it is—it stops.
<string>We found our mark. Olivia's got a spark in her<lf>eyes. It's all good news, to me.
<string>Only question on my mind: did you carve materials<lf>from that leviathan?
<string>Alma, can we go yet?
<string>Patience. We need to be prepared.
<string>I'm ready! What are we waiting for?
<string>Nata, no good will come of getting wound up.
<string>You know how we made it this far?<lf>By taking it one step at a time.
<string>OK, but can we step faster?
<string>Oh...Hello.
<string>How are you doing, Nata?
<string>I'm fine. Same as always.<lf>I just want to get going already.
<string>The Wraith's going to get away!
<string>And we'll be worse off if we rush in.<lf>We can't run past our limits, Nata.
<string>Yes, but... I can't wipe that image from my mind.
<string>It's like my heart is already there,<lf>begging for the rest of me to catch up.
<string>Hunter, is it true you had a run-in with<lf>the White Wraith?
<string>(Talk about the White Wraith)
<string>(Use the Facility)
<string>(End Conversation)
<string>Wow... I can't believe it exists...
<string>Well, I mean, I do. It's not like I thought<lf>we were chasing a ghost...
<string>But all of a sudden what happened to<lf>Nata and his village feels a lot more real.
<string>A second encounter can't have been<lf>any less traumatic for him...
<string>He's going to need our care and support.
<string>Are you ready to go meet the Wudwuds?
<string>Yeah, all set.
<string>What's your take on the Wraith?
<string>I need a little more time.
<string>Alright. Let's go, then.
<string>The White Wraith... We finally found it.
<string>Its color, the chain-like appendages...<lf>Everything is just as Nata described.
<string>Seems so. How's he doing?
<string>He's pretty shaken up, and I don't blame him.
<string>We need to keep an eye on him to ensure all that<lf>turmoil doesn't turn into anger and hate.
<string>OK. I sure hope the Wudwuds saw something...
<string>The Wudwuds should be this way.
<string>The rain's let up. The forest is so radiant.
<string>Yeah... After everything, I forgot how<lf>pretty nature can be.
<string>Whoa...
<string>There's a whole flutter of them!
<string>Look, those ants are carrying leaves!
<string>It's stunning.
<string>But how do they taste?
<string>Anything I can use for the hunt?
<string>Yeah... A true moment of natural beauty.
<string>Everything's so...twinkly.
<string>It sure is pretty.
<string><COLOR FF0000>#Rejected#</COLOR> Dia_stCh0109_Ms002160_0260_t007a
<string>Heh. Eyeing the menu, are we?
<string>There are lots of cultures that consume insects.
<string>Insects deserve more credit.<lf>They pollinate, break things down...
<string>Without them, we wouldn't have this forest.
<string>Some ant species are known to bring in useful items.
<string>So do the ants in this forest, from the looks of it.
<string>Maybe they'll carry in some healing items.
<string>Ants: A hunter's new best friend.
<string>Look! A school of fish.
<string>Meow!
<string>They're pretty.
<string>They taste any good?
<string>Will they help with the hunt?
<string>They look like a river of stars!
<string>What are they called?
<string>Well, those are Stardusters.<lf>I saw some Sushifish, too.
<string>Stardusters always move in schools.
<string>Well, those are Stardusters.<lf>I saw some Sushifish, too.
<string>Sushifish are consumed all around the world.<lf>I wouldn't be surprised if the Wudwuds eat them too!
<string>Wow...
<string>I say we grill 'em.
<string>Well, those are Stardusters.<lf>I saw some Sushifish, too.
<string>Sushifish scales have healing properties.
<string>Great Sushifish scales even increase your natural<lf>recovery abilities.
<string>Sounds like a purr-tty good snack!
<string>Hey, look!
<string>It's like...a rainbow!
<string>It's beautiful.
<string>And so many different flavors.
<string>Can I use them for the hunt?
<string>You could say it's a...birdbow!
<string>Haha... Three out of ten.
<string>[chuckles]
<string>Nata, you laughed!
<string>That was so...
<string>I think that might be my favorite sight today.
<string>There are rules about which creatures in each<lf>region we can catch for consumption.
<string>I'm afraid those birds aren't among them.
<string>Good thing the Guild keeps us well fed.
<string>We're visitors, so we should be grateful for what<lf>we are allowed to sample.
<string>Does that hunter brain of yours ever turn off?
<string>Nata, this is what people call a "workaholic."<lf>That's your new word for the day.
<string>Worka...holic?
<string>Seeing the world through a practical lens can get<lf>you out of some tough spots.
<string>Still, everything has their place in the ecosystem—<lf>even us. We should only take what we need.
<string>The forest really is diverse, huh?
<string>Obviously, but never got to stop and smell the roses.
<string>Look, the water over there is clear.
<string>It's not often you get to see the environment<lf>change so rapidly.
<string>The red water, the downpour, and now it's so sparkly.<lf>My eyes are spinning!
<string>Great. Now I'm hungry...
<string>Now that you mention it, when's the last time<lf>we ate?
<string>What would you all have if you could pick anything?
<string>Fish!
<string>Cheese!
<string>Something spicy!
<string>Hunting sounds like a really hard job.
<string>There's so much to keep track of!
<string>A hunter's job is to observe and comprehend.
<string>What for?
<string>So that when the time comes, they'll be able<lf>to choose the better path.
<string>The better path...I wonder what that is...
<string>Much greetifications, low creatures.<lf>Are you here for our glorifulness honey?
<string>Hello. Actually, we have a few questions,<lf>if that's all right?
<string>Have you seen the White Wraith?
<string>What was that monster by the dam?
<string>What are you doing here?
<string>(End Conversation)
<string>A monster with chain-like appendages arrived<lf>during the downpour.
<string>Did you happen to see where it went?
<string>Nay, none of us had eyes for such seeings.<lf>Not while we are preoccupated with honey-basking!
<string>During the downpour, we encountered a leviathan.
<string>It covered itself in a veil of water.
<string>Ahh! Lord of forest! It appears when<lf>the sky falls out.
<string>I guess it stays in the water until the rains come.<lf>The flooding must widen its area of activity.
<string>Given that, it must be the forest's apex predator.
<string>I see you're busy gathering honey.
<string>Preslicedly. After the sky falls out,<lf>a sparkling settles over the forest.
<string>Water, greeneries, honey. All is most twinklest.
<string>This is the way of the forest and<lf>Wudwuds since BIG time ago!
<string>A promise of something brighter after the rains...
<string>Over the generations, the Wudwuds have learned<lf>to live in harmony with this place.
<string>Yes, yes. Harmony! Good word!
<string>Well, nobody saw anything...<lf>The trail has gone cold.
