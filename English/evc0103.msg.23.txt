<string>This is the way down.
<string>I've dissolved the Wyvern Milk's bonds.
<string>What's here in the pouch is enough<lf>for formations of this size.
<string>This same substance, at a higher purity and solidified...
<string>is what makes Nata's pendant.
<string>You're sure about this?
<string>I have to. I have to see for myself.
<string>Alright.
<string>Recently, a Guardian sentry has been seen<lf>wandering the area ahead.
<string>If it finds you there's no outrunning it.
<string>Be careful.
<string>After you've followed the path a ways,<lf>take the roots up to higher ground.
<string>You'll find sanctuary.
<string>Thank you.
<string>You have the vision to walk a path my people<lf>never could. I wish you luck.
<string>Travel safely.
