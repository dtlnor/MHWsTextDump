<string>So, have you gotten all these new names<lf>and faces down?
<string>'Course. Perfectly memorized the second I met 'em.
<string>Mm-hmm. That's what you said five years ago.
<string>Oh, hey—something's bugging me about one of<lf>the parts in that weapon hilt.
<string>You mind if I give it a once-over later?
<string>Sure, you know best. I'll leave it to you.
<string>Oh, did I mention? Rosso's in a jam.
<string>Rosso? Of Ferrum Unit?
<string>So close. You're thinking of Griffin.
<string>Are we in for another long haul?
<string>It's looking that way.
<string>Eh, I'm not bothered. I'll go anywhere as long as<lf>I've got you and Erik and Athos.
<string>I'm telling you, I don't think I did<lf>anything wrong.
<string>Oh, I know... Believe me, I know.
<string>And I'm not turning back.
<string>...Good.
<string>I've been searching and searching, but it's like<lf>some things just don't want to be found.
<string>I was really hoping the journey east might bring<lf>some new clues.
<string>It's already there, inside you.<lf>Isn't that enough?
<string>Not by a long shot.
<string>Hey, you free?
<string>Do I look like I'm free?
<string>Ha ha ha.
