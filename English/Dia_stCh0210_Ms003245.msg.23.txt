<string>Oh, it's the..."bird" unit.
<string>We have an important matter to discuss.
<string>Never mind.
<string>Huh, OK.
<string>Put your backs in it! This is our village,<lf>and we WILL protect it!
<string>This has never happened before, but that's no<lf>excuse to sit around doing nothing.
<string>We had this coming, after all that talk of wishing<lf>every day could be the festival...
<string>Hurry, hurry!
<string>Believe in the travelers!
<string>How could we let this happen...
<string>We can't give up now!
<string>Move, move, move!
<string>Leave the monkey business to the Hunter!<lf>We've got our own problems to solve!
<string>Maki, this is no time to hesitate!
<string>We've got our work cut out for us...
<string>OK. There's hope for us yet...
<string>Gemma, how should I handle this?
<string>Just gonna move this over here...
<string>We can do this! <ITALIC>I</ITALIC> can do this!
<string>I think I can free myself up for a bit. Whatcha need?
<string>I'd like to take a look at my gear.
<string>(End Conversation)
<string>Got it. Let's get to it!
<string>Right. Good luck with that hunt.
<string>Are we going to be OK?
<string>Don't you worry. Everyone's fighting to save<lf>the village!
<string>What if they can't?
<string>They will! Just you wait and see!
<string>I know what I told the kids, but...what's going to<lf>happen to us?
<string>No, no. I can't get to thinking like that. I've<lf>gotta keep it together.
<string>This lump in my gut... I've got a bad feeling here.
<string>Sorry, only a coward's ramblings. Just ignore me.
<string>What's the plan if this doesn't work?
<string>Get the children out—that's the first thing.
<string>You guys'll take care of those big apes? Are you<lf>sure you know what you're saying?
<string>I'm a little skeptical that there's any human in<lf>this world who can manage that.
<string>Ahh! The Everforge... It's spouting flames...
<string>I wanna help too!
<string>Yeah, tell us what to do!
<string>What you can do is stay put.<lf>Don't you get any ideas.
<string>Hey traveler, I can help too, can't I? Everybody's<lf>doing their part.
<string>I'm gonna help out, too!
<string>Ahh, traveler. Go on and laugh. Laugh at this old<lf>fool who can't keep these children in line.
<string>Never thought something like this would help me<lf>understand how Yabran's felt all this while.
<string>It's burning fierce...
<string>It sure is...
<string>Burning fierce...like my heart does for you.
<string>Yeah... Wait—Wh-What?
<string>I wonder what she's thinking... You have any idea?
<string>Did you hear what he said back there?<lf>I didn't quite catch it...
<string>You call this a fire? This isn't a fire!<lf>It's a fizzle!
<string>Are you crazy? What about the monsters?<lf>Aren't you scared?
<string>NO! I was forged in Azuz!<lf>If it ain't hot, I'm not cooking!
<string>Huh. You're braver than me.
<string>Th-This is n-nothing! A-Absolutely no problem! Y-Yup!
<string>The whole world's gone crazy. I can't keep up!<lf>Aren't you scared, traveler?
<string>Shouldn't we do more to help that traveler?
<string>No, the chief has forbidden it.<lf>We'd only be getting in their way.
<string>Every person has a role.<lf>Ours is to protect this place.
<string>Well, I sure hope they know what they're doing.
<string>The chief told us to wait here, but I can't bring<lf>myself to sit still.
<string>We're leaving the monsters to you, traveler. All<lf>we can do is believe.
<string>Do you really think they'll get that old forge<lf>working?
<string>Let Gemma worry about that.<lf>Our job is to stay here on watch.
<string>Right! Gotta keep our peepers peeled.

<string>How could this have happened...?
<string>We'll just have to make it work somehow.
