<string>I just received word that Professor Fabius has<lf>returned from his Gore Magala search.
<string>We're to meet him at the Iceshard Cliffs Base Camp.<lf>We should hurry!
<string>Alright, let's go.
<string>Good, you're here.
<string>I've received reports on your agile response to<lf>the conditions in each region. Well done.
<string>Professor, that armor... Does that mean—
<string>I have a report of my own to offer. I'll explain<lf>once everyone is assembled.
<string>Avis Unit, Astrum Unit, my apologies for keeping<lf>you waiting. Here are my findings.
<string>After investigating each region, I have determined<lf>this to be the territory of a Gore Magala.
<string><COLOR FF0000>#Rejected#</COLOR> Dia_stCh1001_Ms010110_0030_t003
<string>As evidence of that, we recently took this Wudwud into<lf>our care—afflicted by the Frenzy Virus.
<string>It's unclear whether a Wudwud's body is capable of<lf>weathering the virus. At this rate, he may not...
<string>Furthermore, I've arrived at a theory. The Dragontorch's<lf>excessive output, the lasting weather Inclemency...
<string>I believe both of these phenomena stem from<lf>a single root cause: Gore Magala.
<string>What? How— Wait, a virus! Interesting...<lf>You're right, the dots are starting to line up.
<string><COLOR FF0000>#Rejected#</COLOR> Dia_stCh1001_Ms010110_0030_t009
<string>Fascinating... It's true the virus exacerbates any<lf>violent tendencies in its host. Given that...
<string>It could be that this excessive energy output<lf>is a symptom, or perhaps an immune response?
<string>Yes, yes! And if we're talking infection, that starts<lf>to clarify what we're dealing with. This is big.
<string>The Torch is some kind of organic structure...<lf>The damn thing's alive!
<string>My thoughts exactly. And as an organism, it may<lf>respond to treatment. I'm sure you follow, Erik?
<string>The antiviral compound you describe in your thesis.<lf>We'll need a tissue sample from the infection vector.
<string>You think the Dragontorch will respond to...medicine?<lf>And would that same cure work on Rove?
<string>There's hope. If they do share the same affliction,<lf>a cure for Rove could perhaps be a cure for both.
<string>The first step in testing that is slaying that Gore<lf>Magala. To stop the virus's further spread...
<string>And to collect a tissue sample to derive a cure.<lf>Henceforth, that is our primary priority!
<string>Understood. Then we'll hurry back to conduct any<lf>final analysis to be ready to treat the Torch.
<string>I'll keep a close eye on Rove's condition while<lf>examining the sample I took from him.
<string>Good. Hunter, you'll join me in slaying this Gore<lf>Magala. I've sent my men out to scout its location.
<string>Speak to me as soon as you're prepared to depart.
<string>Are you ready to leave, Hunter?
<string>Yeah, let's go.
<string>Please wait just a bit longer.
<string>Alright. Time is our enemy here as much as Gore<lf>Magala. Let's hurry to the rendezvous point.
<string>Very well. See that you are fully prepared.
<string>Hurry! We can't let it get out of sight!
<string>You! There's no escape!
<string>Another Frenzied monster!?
<string>We've no choice. Deal with it!
<string>Yes, sir!
<string><COLOR FF0000>#Rejected#</COLOR> Dia_stCh1001_Ms010110_0080_t001
<string>This must be its nest... Stay sharp.<lf>From here on out it's do or die.
<string>Blast! It's Frenzied! Be on your guard, now!<lf>Don't let your courage waver!
<string>Rex, Cobb... You had better be all right.
<string>When you're ready, accept the quest<lf>to continue the investigation.
<string>Impressive... Admirably done! That should put<lf>a halt to the virus's spread.
<string><COLOR FF0000>#Rejected#</COLOR> Dia_stCh1001_Ms010110_0110_t002
<string>You'll be able to compound the medicine here?
<string>Yes. What I lack in facilities here is made up<lf>for by an excellent assistant. We'll see it done.
<string>Good... We'll continue to monitor him, but his<lf>condition has stabilized.
<string>A success, despite the circumstances. You did<lf>well with such limited resources, Erik.
<string>I couldn't have done it without that tissue sample.<lf>Not to mention your thesis, sir.
<string>I just hope the Dragontorch responds to it<lf>as well as our fuzzy friend...
<string><COLOR FF0000>#Rejected#</COLOR> Dia_stCh1001_Ms010110_0120_t005
<string>The Avis Unit should be delivering it now. We'll<lf>just have to put our faith in Werner and wait.
<string>Amazing... Even I can see the change.<lf>Is it taking effect already?
<string><COLOR FF0000>#Rejected#</COLOR> Dia_stCh1001_Ms010110_0130_t002
<string><COLOR FF0000>#Rejected#</COLOR> Dia_stCh1001_Ms010110_0130_t003
<string><COLOR FF0000>#Rejected#</COLOR> Dia_stCh1001_Ms010110_0130_t004
<string><COLOR FF0000>#Rejected#</COLOR> Dia_stCh1001_Ms010110_0130_t005
<string>Yes. But as much as I'd like to take the credit,<lf>the Wyvern Milk is what's working most of the magic.
<string>If not for it amplifying the effects of the treatment,<lf>you'd never see it recover this fast.
<string>That said, another Gore Magala could turn up at<lf>some point. Are you worried it might happen again?
<string>It's a fair point...but I'm not too concerned.<lf>Especially if this thing has organic properties.
<string><COLOR FF0000>#Rejected#</COLOR> Dia_stCh1001_Ms010110_0130_t009
<string>I'd like to pick Erik's brain about this, but<lf>there's a chance it's developed antibodies now.
<string>And if the Wyvern Milk magnifies that resistance<lf>too, it'd take a hell of a lot to break through it.
<string>I'm not ready to be quite that optimistic. This<lf>thing is still a big unknown. And a threat.
<string>...Regardless. Werner, continue your research<lf>here. I'll be monitoring the area closely as well.
<string>Understood. We'll head outside, then.
<string>The cycles should return to normal in each region,<lf>but I'd like to keep monitoring them.
<string>He seems quite drained. But he's done well to hold<lf>on this long.
<string>I...I'm... Nn... The me, in...inside me, is...
<string>I'll handle things here. In his current condition,<lf>there's still hope.
<string>Please, you deal with Gore Magala!
<string>Grgh...! Nn...nragh...
<string>That's it—you can't give in. Keep fighting...<lf>Hold out just a little more!
