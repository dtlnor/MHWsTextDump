<string>Alright, let's get started in the forest. Look around<lf>for any signs of change to the ecosystem.
<string>Right.
<string>But we still don't know what we'll find out there.<lf>Nata, you stand by at Base Camp, just in case.
<string>Alright. Please be careful, too.
<string>Then we're off! Just...as soon as we've fully<lf>prepared. Sorry, I'm excited.
<string>Come and speak to me once you're ready to go.
<string>It's always an honor, sir.
<string>Olivia. The pleasure is mine, to be in such<lf>accomplished company. You've done...truly well.
<string>I'm also enjoying this return to fieldwork, even<lf>if only to serve as the Guild's envoy.
<string>An "envoy," sir?
<string>Right. For now, we'll be the only ones out here<lf>carrying on research.
<string>But that doesn't mean the Guild isn't listening.<lf>The professor is here as their representative.
<string>We've been estranged for too long.<lf>It's past time we reacquainted ourselves.
<string>Yes, sir. And if, um... If there's ever a way I<lf>can help with that, I hope you'll let me.
<string>I welcome your insights, as one familiar with both<lf>worlds. Will you continue to aid Avis Unit?
<string>Yes, sir. Thank you. I... I'll do my best!
<string>Forgive me for being direct, sir, but what exactly<lf>are the Guild's views on the investigation ahead?
<string>We have two priorities: First, investigating the state<lf>of the Dragontorch, absent Zoh Shia's presence.
<string>Second, an accounting of any effects on the local<lf>ecology here as a consequence of that change.
<string>And the area surrounding Sild. Astrum Unit, namely<lf>Erik and Werner, will focus their efforts there.
<string>Surveying the other regions is a task for Avis<lf>Unit. You've seen more of these lands than anyone.
<string>Understood, sir.
<string>Likewise. We'll see it done.
<string>We'll begin our search in the forest. It should be easy to spot<lf>any signs of change in a biome that lush.
<string>Very good. If any of us discovers something, reach<lf>out to the others. I'll be counting on you all.
<string>Ready to depart? Let me double-check a few things<lf>before we go. Over here, please.
<string>Shall we head out? Or did you<lf>have another quest in mind?
<string>Let's go.
<string>I'd like to see the quest list.
<string>(End Conversation)
<string>Perfect. Then let's begin our investigation!
<string>Kinda strange seeing the entirety of the Eastlands<lf>in a season of Plenty.
<string>It is, but also incredible what the<lf>Dragontorch is capable of!
<string>Even if this surge is temporary, it's hard to<lf>imagine the effect of all this on the ecosystem.
<string>Which just makes the prospect of<lf>investigating it all the juicier, no?
<string>Oh yeah.
<string>Wonder what would've happened<lf>if we'd stopped it...
<string>I couldn't even begin to imagine. That thing is<lf>far beyond our understanding.
<string>Agreed.
<string>At some point, we'll have to put our heads<lf>together with the Astrum Unit and figure it out.
<string>But for now, we've got our plates full observing<lf>this biome, and I plan on enjoying the meal.
<string>Meee too!
<string>As expected, this is different from previous<lf>seasons of Plenty.
<string>I'd like to get a better look.<lf>Let's head for the canopy!
<string>Alright.
<string>Up there... A Wudwud.
<string>You help! Red ones BIG trespass!
<string>Er... Can you describe these "red ones"?
<string>Many many red ones... Flappy flappy wings!<lf>Big fire from beak!
<string>Just going off of that description, I'd be<lf>tempted to say she means a Yian Kut-Ku.
<string>But they're normally territorial, so it's kind of odd<lf>that so "many many" would gather together...
<string>Well... Yian Kut-Ku DO prefer forests, so maybe<lf>we've just found our first anomaly.
<string>Fire beak! Many many! This way!
<string>Well, I guess she wants us to follow her.
<string>Keep in mind that the target must be captured<lf>so we can study it!
<string>We've received some useful supplies for capturing!<lf>Lay a trap for the target, then hit it with some Tranq Bombs.
<string>Now's your chance!<lf>Hit it with some Tranq Bombs!
<string>Don't attack the target anymore!<lf>Our objective right now is to capture it!
<string>When you're ready to continue the investigation,<lf>head to the Quest Counter and accept the quest.
<string>That was a little chaotic...but thank you.<lf>You're free to head back to base. As for me...
<string>I need to speak to the research team about what we should<lf>do moving forward, and the Kut-Ku we captured.
<string>Hmm, Yian Kut-Ku gathering in unprecedented<lf>numbers is a significant development.
<string>Amazing... So much life is coming back.
<string>Yes, we're seeing clear reverberations in both<lf>the diversity and quantity of life.
<string>Or perhaps a reversion, I should say.<lf>To the natural state of things here.
<string>My thoughts as well.
<string>All of the energy that Zoh Shia was siphoning<lf>away is free to flow out into the land.
<string>And the ecosystem is beginning to rebuild... The<lf>other regions may be undergoing similar changes.
<string>Indeed. I ask that you continue your investigation.<lf>I leave the choice of destination to you.
<string>However, it's not the Dragontorch, Sild, or the<lf>Wyvern's Rest that concerns me. No.
<string>I'll have Astrum Unit focus their efforts<lf>there awhile longer.
<string>These changes may be affecting the villagers.<lf>Maybe we could ask them? See if they need help?
<string>Good point. Alright, let's head out.
<string>Good morning. Did you have a good rest?
<string>A sandship arrived while you were sleeping.<lf>Olivia has returned, too.
<string>What do you say we stop by the command tent<lf>when we get the chance?
<string>You look good. I'm glad to see everyone is doing well.
<string>If you haven't heard, we have a distinguished visitor.<lf>Shall we meet and discuss our next steps?
<string>That's why I'm here.
<string>Give me a minute.
<string>Good. He's inside.
<string>Alright. But let's not keep him waiting too long.
<string>Forest, happy!
<string>Happy, happy!
<string>Forest happierest!
<string>The forest is happy! The Wudwuds are happy!
<string>Creaturings. Eatings. Forest movings.
<string>Everything big happy now.
<string>Happy now, happy now!
<string>Eggy-egg.
<string>You see? BIG Eggy-egg.
<string>Eggy-egg!
<string>I see... An egg.
<string>Eggy egg egg.
<string>Egg-ah egg. Big eggy egg. Yummy yum egg.
<string>Yummy. Yum. Egg-cellent!
<string>This no see before.
<string>It is good touchings.
<string>These tracks are... Hm, interesting.
<string>Many different ones here. Many not knowing ones.
<string>Ones are dangerousness? This big trouble.
<string>Is that...?
<string>Up ahead... Wudwuds.
<string>It's almost as if the forest is more alive than usual.
