<string>Most people hear "mining" and think it's just<lf>carving up rock into little scraps we can use...
<string>But to me, it's always felt more like we're<lf>helping the ore be free.
<string>Our job is to let it out into the world. You know?
<string>I don't think any amount of training could give me<lf>the eye the chief has for ore.
<string>I look at him and can't help but think that's what<lf>people mean when they say "genius."
<string>...Did you need something?
<string>That moment all my little ore babies become one...
<string>Grow and change, my little ores!
<string>If there was ever a time to visit Azuz,<lf>it would be now.
<string>You all are traveling from region to region, yes?
<string>Does Azuz seem like an unusual place to your eyes?
<string>The Firespring Festival culminates in the creation<lf>of the stunning metal Oricalcite.
<string>Perhaps it's our combined effort that gives<lf>it a luster unlike any ore found in nature.
<string>It's just a little delay...right?
<string>I feel bad that this happened after you traveled<lf>all the way here.
<string>I hope it won't dissuade you from coming again.
<string>I've never heard of the Everforge acting this way!
<string>I was truly afraid for a moment there...but I'm<lf>glad we produced some exceptional Oricalcite.
<string>It's proof that we Stonefolk found materials<lf>of the highest quality.
<string>My job is to mine quality ore.
<string>Bad things are happening now because we fought<lf>back against the monsters...
<string>We all have wished that the Firespring<lf>would go on forever.
<string>But some dreams are best left as just that...
<string>All of us are exhausted.
<string>I see now that the festival is only fun because<lf>it has an ending...
<string>I hope this isn't an omen of some<lf>terrible disaster to come...
<string>The Black Flame has been subdued,<lf>thanks to you all, but...
<string>What is Azuz to do now, going forward?
<string>Things have been pretty great in Azuz, lately.
<string>We've all been through a lot here.
<string>The Bonefolk are pretty interesting.
<string>They have been quite informative.
<string>The Bonefolk are redesigning their bone press<lf>and asked if I'd come have a look.
<string>Our brainstorming has been pretty fun actually...
