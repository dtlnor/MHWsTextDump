<string>I greet thee, impending death. Our meeting was<lf>ordained the day I left the forest.
<string>I knew this end would come—<lf>as didst thee, great spider.
<string>Do I act? Nay, I shall embrace this chance to reflect.
<string>Bewitched by the past, bound by fibers...<lf>A fool I was to think myself free.
<string>What the world decrees, nature administers...<lf>I give myself to its inevitable sways.
<string>How marvelous. A fitting backdrop<lf>for this wanderer's final gasp.
<string>Aye then! What fate wills, fate must.
<string>The end... How peculiar...
<string>So many sights left unseen...
<string>Ahh! This is unexpected.
<string>Hm! Just what I needed to doff my drowsiness.
<string>Has my salvation come?
<string>Round and round and round...
<string>Who art thou, resisting what has already been decided?
<string>Thank you. I shall relish my newfound freedom.
<string>This is for you. Use it well.
<string>Free to wander once more!<lf>I shall not forget this.
<string>One day, I shall repay this boon.
<string>Bound by fate, and by its will,<lf>we shall meet again.
<string>Art thou my salvation, then?
<string>Methinks I am getting the "hang" of this...
<string>What lies ahead for these newly emancipated limbs?
<string>So fate has spoken.<lf>Until our next tryst, great spider...
<string>Is it me, or were today's bindings loose?
<string>My headpiece is safe, thus am I.
