<string>Ah, perfect. There is a matter I'm eager to ask<lf>your opinion on.
<string>Go right ahead.
<string>I am told many mysteries still remain about the<lf>ecology of the Guardians.
<string>For instance... Do you think tempered Guardians<lf>could ever exist? Or a tempered Xu Wu?
<string>Their desire to survive is no less fierce than<lf>for other monsters. I wouldn't be surprised.
<string>Especially with their dynamic of eat or be eaten.<lf>Why, have you seen something lately?
<string>No, it... It was really just a momentary glimpse.<lf>Nothing certain. But it felt unlike other Xu Wu...
<string>I've learned it's often better to listen to my gut.<lf>If it turns out you're wrong, no harm done.
<string>I'll have the Guild look into it, and deal with it<lf>if needed.
<string>Th-thank you! That would be a big relief.<lf>Sorry to trouble you.
<string>Ah, welcome back. ...What did you find?
<string>That your hunch was correct, so thank you for<lf>sharing it. They were tempered monsters.
<string>And two mutual predators, what's more. If left<lf>unchecked, they could have caused a lot of damage.
<string>We were able to prevent that, thanks to your early<lf>warning. I'm glad you didn't hesitate.
<string>Is that so... I'm relieved to hear it. <lf>I'm- I'm glad I brought it up.
<string>You've done much to ensure our safety here. I'd<lf>like to repay that kindness in some way.
<string>Perhaps I could assist you by gathering materials?<lf>Don't hesitate to ask if you need anything.
