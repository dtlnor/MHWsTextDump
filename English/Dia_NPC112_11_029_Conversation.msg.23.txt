<string>The Sandtide is coming again. With all that<lf>thunder, too. Ugh, I already feel depressed.
<string>Wish I was at home.
<string>I found the prettiest girl with the glossiest hair you<lf>ever did see. Truly the light of my life.
<string>Oh, I'm talking about Seikret, of course. Their<lf>coats take just as much coiffing as our hair.
<string>Do you all have a place to go?
<string>You'll be in trouble if the Sandtide hits and<lf>you don't have somewhere to take cover.
<string>Those sure are some...interesting clothes<lf>you're all wearing.
<string>The sky's gotten dark. Won't be long until the<lf>Sandtide now.
<string>Ahh, I'm worried about my poor babies.
<string>Everything is blooming now that the storm has<lf>passed. I'd love to take the Seikret out.
<string>Hello. Come meet my beautiful babies! Aren't they<lf>just the most perfect creatures you've ever seen?
<string>Hey, I hear your precious little friends are called<lf>"Felynes." Is that right?
<string>It's my first time seeing a Lynian. They have the<lf>most beautiful, fluffy coats.
<string>The Sandtide has finally gone and it's now the best<lf>time of the year. Look at all those budding plants!
<string>I've never seen clothes like yours before.<lf>They look...hmm...stiff. And heavy.
<string>You're one of Y'sai's guests, right? You look quite<lf>serious for someone with such a cute, furry friend.
<string>I wanted to ask Zatoh for something. I wonder<lf>where he's gone...
<string>If it weren't for you, my precious beauties here<lf>wouldn't have made it. Thank you so much.
<string>My, that was scary, wasn't it? I really hate the<lf>Sandtide. The thunder frightens my babies so much.
<string>It's not even the season for it! Storms can't just<lf>show up out of nowhere!
<string>Ahhh, I just love the season of Plenty!
<string>Look at how shiny their coats have gotten!
<string>My poor dears have been so restless lately.
<string>Is your Seikret doing all right? You better<lf>be taking good care of him out there.
<string>Yeesh, that was terrifying... It's just been one thing<lf>after another lately.
<string>All I want is to snuggle up with my warm,<lf>fluffy babies.
<string>Oh, you need to see this. A baby Seikret just hatched,<lf>and she is just the CUTEST little thing.
<string>I'm so thankful for the healthy birth. I would do<lf>anything for my babies!
<string>I sure do love when you come through the village.<lf>I always feel a sense of calm.
