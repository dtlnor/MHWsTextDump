<string>The Sandtide is coming again. With all that thunder, too. Ugh, I already feel depressed.
<string>Wish I was at home.
<string>I found the prettiest girl with the glossiest hair you<lf>ever did see. Truly the light of my life.
<string>Oh, I'm talking about Seikret, of course. Their<lf>coats take just as much coiffing as our hair.
<string>Do you all have a place to go?
<string>You'll be in trouble if the Sandtide hits and<lf>you don't have somewhere to take cover.
<string>Those sure are some...interesting clothes you're<lf>all wearing.
<string>The sky's gotten dark. Won't be long until the<lf>Sandtide now.
<string>Ahh, I'm worried about my poor babies.
<string>Everything is blooming now that the storm has<lf>passed. I'd love to take the Seikret out.
<string>Hello. Come meet my beautiful babies! Aren't they<lf>just the most perfect creatures you've ever seen?
<string>Hey, I hear your precious little friends are called<lf>"Felynes." Is that right?
<string>It's my first time seeing a Lynian. They have the<lf>most beautiful, fluffy coats.
<string>The Sandtide has finally gone and it's now the best<lf>time of the year. Look at all those budding plants!
