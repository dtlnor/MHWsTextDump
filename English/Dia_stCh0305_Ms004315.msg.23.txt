<string>They might have info to share too.<lf>Let's head to their camp in the Cliffs.
<string>Before we go, we should do a resupply<lf>and evaluate our equipment.
<string>Please. As if anyone there wanted to hear one<lf>more word of that windbag's garrulous speech!
<string>I for one would've preferred a chair over any of those awards.
<string>Their Guildmaster's an acquaintance, so I'll try to<lf>mention this privately...if we make it home in one piece.
<string>Hey, look who's here.
<string>We took the liberty of building a Base Camp<lf>in this fine place you found for us.
<string>We'll conduct our investigation of the Cliffs from here.
<string>There's something I'd like your thoughts on.
<string>I'd like to talk more later.
<string>We have new info on the White Wraith.<lf>Get ready for this one...
<string>Something on your mind? We'll be around<lf>if you think we can help.
