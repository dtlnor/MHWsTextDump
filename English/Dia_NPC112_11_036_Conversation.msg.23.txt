<string>What do you think of our clothes? I dyed every<lf>last scrap of fabric myself.
<string>Whoever did yours clearly knows<lf>their pigments. Fine work.
<string>You'll never hear someone say they like the wind<lf>pelting them with sand. Not even us locals.
<string>Fabrics with a fine weave can protect your skin<lf>from the sand. That's what makes it valuable.
<string>If you all were going to travel all the way here,<lf>you should have come during the Plenty.
<string>It's all just sad, dry sand during the Fallow.<lf>Plus the Sandtide's drawing near.
<string>Oh! Well, now THAT'S a mighty fine<lf>outfit you have on.
<string>You can see the skill in it, even at a glance.
<string>I didn't realize that strange fashion you wear<lf>held a deeper meaning.
<string>It's a product of your culture, right?
<string>The flowers and plants I use in my dyes grow<lf>during the Plenty.
<string>I ask others to gather them for me, but it's<lf>always fun sorting through what they bring in.
<string>The clothes we wear come into contact<lf>with our Seikret, too.
<string>All the more reason to make them as soft and<lf>pleasing in color as I can.
<string>That outfit of yours is fascinating... I couldn't<lf>reproduce it even if I tried.
<string>Every day's just filled with gratitude.
<string>Ah, Y'sai's guest. Heading out?
<string>Oh, it's you all. Where are you rushing off to?
<string>Weren't you friends of Y'sai's? Come to think of<lf>it, he seemed worked up, too.
<string>Oh, Zatoh? Hmm, I'm not sure where he's gone.
<string>You all were amazing! Wow, just... Wow.
<string>I feel like I understand your clothing now. They're<lf>your work clothes, made for rough work like this.
<string>I don't think I'll ever forget the terror of seeing<lf>all those Doshaguma in the village.
<string>And certainly not the way you chased them off!<lf>Thank you so much.
<string>Uh-oh! Looks like your outfit's showing a little<lf>bit of wear and tear!
<string>I suppose that means you were off hard at work,<lf>huh? Always so impressive...
<string>You're looking pretty sharp today. And I don't just<lf>mean what you're wearing.
<string>The clothes don't make the wearer, after all! Your<lf>class and poise are quite easy on the eyes.
<string>Water's hard to come by during the Fallow.<lf>There's not much to spare for dyeing.
<string>So I spend my time darning old clothes and<lf>taking it easy.
<string>What do you think? In a worst-case scenario,<lf>all we'll have is the clothes on our back.
<string>That's why I'm always saying to never settle for<lf>less than top quality!
<string>I know you're very capable, but I can't help but<lf>worry a little.
<string>It's good to see you're doing well.<lf>Relax and enjoy your time here.
<string>I need to fix up the children's clothes soon. All<lf>that Seikret riding really chews through them.
<string>Some of them are already talking about joining the<lf>Vanguard someday. Eager little sprouts.
