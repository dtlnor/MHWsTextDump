<string>What do you think of our clothes? I dyed every<lf>last scrap of fabric myself.
<string>Whoever did yours clearly know their pigments.<lf>Fine work.
<string>You'll never hear someone say they like the wind<lf>pelting them with sand. Not even us locals.
<string>Fabrics with a fine weave can protect your skin<lf>from the sand. That's what makes it valuable.
<string>If you all were going to travel all the way here,<lf>you should have come during the Plenty.
<string>It's all just sad, dry sand during the Fallow.<lf>Plus the Sandtide's drawing near.
<string>Oh! Well, now THAT'S a mighty fine outfit you<lf>have on.
<string>You can see the skill in it, even at a glance.
<string>The flowers and plants I use in my dyes grow<lf>during the Plenty.
<string>I ask others to gather them for me, but it's<lf>always fun sorting through what they bring in.
<string>The clothes we wear come into contact with our<lf>Seikret, too.
<string>All the more reason to make them as soft and<lf>pleasing in color as I can.
<string>That outfit of yours is fascinating... I couldn't<lf>reproduce it even if I tried.
<string>Every day's just filled with gratitude.
