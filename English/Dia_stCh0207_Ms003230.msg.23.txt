<string>...And just like that, the light blinked out.<lf>You guys get anything?
<string>Let's just say...I'm still investigating. Not gonna<lf>present my findings until I'm certain.
<string>Enough chit-chat, though. You've got a visitor.
<string>Hey, I heard you're looking for an underground<lf>tunnel. Yabran filled me in.
<string>That Landspine continues down into the Subterrane—<lf>I can show you the way if you want.
<string>That might be the tunnel I came through!
<string>That would be great. Let's mount up.
<string>Thanks for guiding us, Satesh.
<string>Just follow me.
<string>Hey, we should stick together.
<string>The place I'm talking about is way down deep,<lf>in an area we call the Subterrane.
<string>Sometimes we go there to mine.<lf>But we generally avoid it.
<string>Between the gas, lava, and monsters, there's too<lf>much that can go wrong and no way to call for help.
<string>Sounds dangerous. We really appreciate you<lf>taking the risk for us.
<string>Naw, it's Yabran you should thank. He went<lf>around the whole village asking for help.
<string>Said he wanted to help out the travelers<lf>who came to his aid.
<string>So I volunteered, basically.
<string>Aww. He did that for us?
<string>There's our ride down.
<string>It'll take us to the Subterrane?
<string>Yep.
<string>That's handy.
<string>We're almost there.
<string>So where does the Landspine lead?
<string>If you look east from the Basin, you'll see<lf>a huge cliff. It stretches to there.
<string>But don't expect me to go near it. As we say in Azuz,<lf>don't go down a hole without a ladder.
<string>A huge cliff... Nata.
<string>Yeah.
<string>Whew... We've come a long way.
<string>Huh? It can't be...
<string>You said this was ice? It wasn't here last time...
<string>But this is the way to your village?
<string>Yeah, I'm sure of it. I remember getting lost here.
<string>Why!? We were so close!
<string>Take it easy. It must have frozen over<lf>in the past few years.
<string>Hey, we should bundle up.<lf>Why don't we set up camp?
<string>I'm already bundled up in my fur coat!
<string>This must be that cliff that Satesh warned us about.
<string>Alright, so... What do you say we head back to the surface and regroup?
<string>Yeah, good idea. Let's see if we can find a way<lf>to the surface.
<string>I'm sorry...
<string>No need for that. C'mon, it'll work out.
<string>Given our orientation, we're likely<lf>under the Cliffs here.
<string>I thought I would know the way... I'm sorry.
<string>Everybody looks cold.
<string>Glad we brought cold-weather gear with us.
<string>Let's head to the surface for now.
<string>Do I dream? Nay. One wakes from a dream,<lf>but this... I feel no such hope.
<string>I must accept it. My day has come at last.
<string>Ah, is this where my wanderings end? The terminus<lf>of my grand quest from my homeland?
<string>Nay, I shall not speak of endings, though I concede<lf>that this ephemeral bleakness took my breath away.
<string>Caught me in its clutches, it did, and refused to<lf>let go. Ha! A wickedly apt turn of phrase.
<string>To pass is beauty. I have borne witness<lf>to this truth time and again.
<string>So what else is there to say but that my turn has<lf>finally come.
<string>Does anybody else hear that voice?
<string>Uh, voice?
<string>Maybe I'm imagining things...
<string>I'll look for an opening and try to free the Wudwud!
<string>What's this? Has Death forsaken me for another?
<string>What's this? The footfalls of destiny grow fainter...
<string>The Wudwud that's strung up is alive for now,<lf>but we need to hurry.
<string>The Wudwud is safe, but we still need to secure the area.<lf>Hunting that Nerscylla is our top priority.
<string>Get the Wudwud down!
<string>Right!
<string>Ah. I stand corrected; my end in disguise you<lf>were not. Many thanks for the daring rescue.
<string>I am Rove, a humble Wudwud questing far from home.
<string>Hello, Rove. I'm Alma. I don't suppose you know<lf>your way around this place, do you?
<string>I do. Ask, and you shall be elucidated.
<string>I'd like to know more about this area.
<string>Tell me about your capture.
<string>(End Conversation)
<string>Well, you might say we're...lost.
<string>Could you help us get our bearings? We're trying to<lf>reach higher ground, but we can't find a way up.
<string>Shall I be your guide? No objections, I insist.<lf>It is the least I can do.
<string>Can I ask how you got caught by the Nerscylla?
<string>Sheer carelessness. Only I am to blame.<lf>My spirit of adventure got the better of me.
<string>Had I only known that I would wind up wound up!<lf>Let that be a lesson to you all.
<string>Well if he's offering, I say we accept.
<string>Rove, we'll need time to get ready.<lf>Do you mind waiting?
