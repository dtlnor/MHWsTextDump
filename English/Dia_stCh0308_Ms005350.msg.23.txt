<string>It slipped into a crack again!
<string>Don't let it blindside you!
<string>Are you OK?
<string>I made sure you have extra supplies this time.<lf>I know you'll make good use of them!
<string>And not a scratch on you. Impressive, Hunter.
<string>Oh, Alma pulled together more supply items than<lf>usual. You get those yet?
<string>Hunter! Thank goodness...!
<string>When I heard a monster grabbed your leg and<lf>dragged you off, I...
<string>What sort of monster could fit through that crack?<lf>I can't even imagine.
<string>Are you OK? Back-to-back hunts with no rest<lf>would take a toll on anyone.
<string>Let's get you ready for another go. I made sure you<lf>have extra supplies for this one!
<string>I noticed that monster doesn't<lf>have any eye-like organs.
<string>It's a safe bet that flash bombs won't do anything.
<string>Are you all right? You handled those<lf>back-to-back hunts like a champ.
<string>We came out of it with valuable new info, too.<lf>Let's return to camp and plan our next move.
<string>That was somethin' else. Who'd have expected<lf>a monster that preys on Guardians?
<string>It didn't even hesitate. And it seemed to know<lf>its way around the capital—where to hunt.
<string>It certainly didn't get that way overnight.
<string>So you think Guardians have established themselves<lf>into Wyveria's ecosystem somehow?
<string>I would need to spend more time observing the<lf>Guardians and their environment to be sure,
<string>but I'd say that theory has some traction.
<string>Then Arkveld has, too.
<string>If it preys, and gets preyed on, then it's<lf>just like any other monster.
<string>The last time we saw it, it was headed further down.
<string>Well, we've driven off the threat... Perhaps it's time<lf>we braved the lower stratum.
<string>I'm game. Let's go.
