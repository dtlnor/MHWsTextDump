<string>You! Climb on. Ride!
<string>Let's follow them. I'm sure they're harmless.<lf>Or...I hope so.
<string>That more of them over there?
<string>They're gathering honey.
<string>Forest ours. You respect!
<string>I'm sorry for losing my cool back there, but that was<lf>a bona fide late-anthroduodecimic groveling idol.
<string>Once I knew they were holding Marianne hostage,<lf>I was powerless to resist...
<string>Oh, but I was worried about our other supplies too.
<string>Look at that. They're everywhere!
<string>And they've got friends.
<string><COLOR FF0000>#Rejected#</COLOR> Dia_stCh0103_Ms001100_0075_t001
<string>Well, that looks fun.
<string>They're feeding!
<string>Big danger! Bad.
<string>There's a boulder on that tree.
<string>No go near. We BIG squish.
<string>Hey, look at them!
<string>Shroo mah moo shroo?
<string>
<string>They're foraging for mushrooms.
<string>
<string>They really get around.
<string>Really getter round.
<string>That structure looks ancient...
<string>I wonder how long ago it was built.
<string>*grunt*
<string>
<string>Are they gonna be OK?
<string>Oh yeah. They BIG OK.
<string>Here we are, yaaay!
<string>Oh, this is beautiful!
<string>Up up up! We climb up!
<string>You come too.
<string>You come too!
<string>I guess we go in here.
<string>Newcomer. You bring. Honey.
<string>Cham, cham. Yummy.
<string>Loud. Too loud.
<string>No! 'Fraid! Graaah!
<string>Inside, inside.
<string>You are impressioned by our<lf>wonderous dancings, yes?
<string>Rah, rah! Shakka, shah!
<string>Ooh... Your wearings are unfamiliar to us. Who are<lf>you, mm?
<string>What wrong? You lost?
<string>What's back this way?
<string>How long have you lived here?
<string>(End Conversation)
<string>What's back this way?
<string>Mmm... Big loud water!<lf>Come from high, fall down low!
<string>Is he talking about a waterfall?<lf>I'd like to see that if we get a chance.
<string>Big wide! Big tall!
<string>How long have you all lived in this forest?
<string>Mmmmmm... Since age of Wyve—hmm?<lf>Many age! Big BIG age!
<string>Wow, so you've been here a very long time.
<string>Do you have friends like you who live in<lf>places other than this forest?
<string>Yes! Very good friend! Name Ranger—<lf>...Huh? No, that not name.
<string>Ramble? No... Roam! Oh no no...
<string>Anyway, friend dashing and BIG cool.
<string>H'okay bye.
<string>Hunter, we have to do what they tell us.
<string>Ha ha! Grovel and feel humblings, for THIS is our<lf>great Wyve... Wyveer? Our city!
<string>I mean this forest belongs to us Wudwuds!<lf>Mind your Ps and Qs.
<string>What an unusual, eldritch tongue they speak!<lf>And yet it feels so fresh and relevant.
<string>Greetings, friend! We mean you no harm.<lf>Would you give us back our tiny house?
<string>We no give back! We have claimed it as tribooty.
<string>BUT! We make deal us! OK! A great menace<lf>is making the troubles by our honey mound.
<string>Its pink fur is big stylish and cool, but its gases<lf>are of a stinknaceous variety.
<string>Chase away big menace, and in our generosities,<lf>we shall return your puny hovel.
<string>Pink fur? You think it's a Congalala?
<string>Sounds like we've got our work cut out for us.
<string>Careful-watch! Graaah!
<string>A due and rightful tribooty, yes.
<string>They found us!
<string>Run!
<string>We is found.
<string>Awwh. Garr.
<string>What, what? You make askings for the temporal use<lf>of your tiny hovel while driving off the big pink?
<string>If required for tribooty, then fine.<lf>But only for the shortest of nappings, mm?
<string>It is an offer most generic.
<string>So they're called Wudwuds, huh? They make<lf>it sound like they've been here forever.
<string>Erik mentioned seeing Congalalas<lf>in the south of the forest.
<string>We've certainly got no shortage of them back west.
<string>And now, we know there's a<lf>healthy population here, too.
<string>OK, let's move out!
<string>Where do you think the Wudwuds learned to speak<lf>our language? They have a very colorful vocabulary.
<string>Seriously. What's a "tribooty"?
<string>I think she meant "tribute"?<lf>You know—payment for us to be here.
<string>This looks like Congalala spoor.
<string>Definitely from a Pinky Stinky!
<string>Tiny hovel. Belong to us.
<string>Gaha. Guhuhu. Gaaah.
<string>GWAAAH!
<string>Do you hear that?
<string>Something's snoring. Move as quietly as you can.
<string>I think it might be that Congalala...
<string>Ugh, I think I'm gonna be sick...
<string>Blegh! Use a Deodorant, stat!
<string>Hey, are you OK?
<string>Unless we reclaim our campsite from the Wudwuds,<lf>we'll never make any headway with our investigation.
<string>So as irregular as this is, we have to hunt that Congalala.
<string>Nice work, Hunter! Let's report back to the Wudwuds.
<string>I heard all about your great exploitations<lf>in driving off the pink menace.
<string>Can we have our campsite back now?
<string>Tell us about the forest's monsters.
<string>Where did you learn our language?
<string>(End Conversation)
<string>Can we have our "puny hovel" back now?
<string>But of course, friend! The Wudwuds' forest is<lf>now your forest too.
<string>Here's to many lopsided transactions between us.<lf>...You have any pelts to trade?
<string>What if we offered you...say, a Doshaguma pelt?<lf>Brown fur, big fangs, ridges on its forehead?
<string>Brown pelts? BIG no. Fur is rough. And besides,<lf>brown fur everywhere. No need!
<string>Too many in our forest now. Them and their big kahuna—<lf>ohh, you don't want to get messy with THAT one.
<string><COLOR FF0000>#Rejected#</COLOR> Dia_stCh0103_Ms001100_0300_t016a
<string>What can you tell us about the other monsters in the<lf>forest? Ever seen a big white monster come through?
<string>White monster... White monster— You don't mean<lf>THAT nightmarish creature?
<string>Many times it drags shiny not-white things, too.<lf>It shows up when the sky falls out. Very scarifying!
<string>When the sky falls out?
<string>Yes yes. Sky falls. Menace comes.
<string>Where did you learn our language?<lf>You speak it...so well!
<string>Ohh, you are most perceptious. I indeed am<lf>the greatest Wudwud linguineist in the forest!
<string>We have spoken your tongue since times of old,<lf>when we served as watra purefires.
<string>However, that is no longer! Today, we use your<lf>speech for transactioning with the desertfolk.
<string>Oh, so you have contact with the people of Kunafa?
<string>Yes. They pay tribooty to enter the forest,<lf>and we grant them passage.
<string>Generous. Yes?
<string>I suppose we'll be going, then...
<string>Until our next wheelings and dealings.
<string>So, the Doshaguma must be traveling in a pack,<lf>and they have a leader.
<string>In numbers, monsters become emboldened.<lf>And with a strong-willed leader...
<string>We'd better follow up.
<string>Yeah. Let's head back to camp.
<string>Oh, you're back, good.<lf>We've been managing here, but...
<string>Now that Base Camp is up and running, little<lf>problems are cropping up left and right.
<string>Might be good to see if anyone needs a hand.<lf>But that's what us hunters are here for, right?
<string><COLOR FF0000>#Rejected#</COLOR> Dia_stCh0103_Ms001100_0310_t008
<string>I don't suppose it would hurt to see what people need<lf>while we continue our Doshaguma investigation.
