<string>Hey!
<string>Tasheen!
<string>Tasheen!
<string>Against all odds, you found another way.
<string>You hunters are incredible.
<string>You chose a path that we never could.
<string>Tasheen... We CAN choose.
<string>Arkveld chose, too. It found its own way to live.
<string>So did the other Guardians.
<string>And now it's time for the Keepers to step away<lf>from duty...
<string>And truly live.
<string>Thank you. For everything.
