<string>Hey, mind if I toss another request your way?
<string>A quest was posted to investigate the Guardians<lf>and I was hoping you'd come with me.
<string>I've got another little something I'd like<lf>to test.
<string>Of course. What have you got this time?
<string>Well...it's a new weapon.
<string>I don't know if it'll work, but finding out is<lf>half of the excitement yeah?
<string>Sounds like fun either way.
<string>Great! Just accept the quest when you're ready!
<string>Another successful hunt! All thanks to my new invention!
<string>I didn't do too bad, myself! I managed to nick some<lf>materials with my new Plunderang!
<string>You can use them to prep for your next hunt!
<string>I will, thanks. Heh, I don't know how you come up<lf>with this stuff.
<string>Well, I was brainstorming when I remembered something<lf>I heard about the New World—Plunderblades!
<string>It's a tool that some of the Grimalkynes there use<lf>to gather materials. Smart, huh?
<string>Well, thanks. You always know just what I need<lf>before I even know I need it.
<string>Eh heh heh... Same to you, partner.
<string>Working with you, it's just new discovery after<lf>new adventure... I'm having a blast!
<string>I can't wait to explore more! So keep me around,<lf>yeah?
<string>Oh, you're stuck with me. Don't worry!
<string>Yep, I think that'll do it. Thanks, partner!<lf>Let's talk more at Base Camp.
