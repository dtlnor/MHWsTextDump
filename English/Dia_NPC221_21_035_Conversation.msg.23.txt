<string>I never thought I'd get the opportunity to lay the<lf>groundwork for research in a new region at my age...
<string>Life never ceases to surprise us.
<string>I brought Dareel and Samin here with me.<lf>You might call them my apprentices.
<string>They're inexperienced yet, but they have passion<lf>and potential. I have high hopes for their future.
<string>I'm all for hard work and dedication, but at times<lf>it's best to surrender oneself to nature's flow.
<string>Often it's when we pause our search for answers<lf>that they come into clearer focus.
<string>Patience is a necessity for ecological research. Most<lf>of the job is watching and waiting...and waiting.
<string>Perhaps that's why so many of us are Wyverians...<lf>The field demands time on a scale few can afford.
<string>The cycle of life ever turns...
<string>We must never forget that we are a part of nature<lf>ourselves.
<string>Ahh, yes. From the Avis Unit... I've heard the<lf>stories. I am {0}, an endemic life researcher.
<string>My work will likely entail a fair bit of work for<lf>you as well. I'll be relying on you.
<string>I'd like nothing more than to start studying rare<lf>local life...but I suppose setting up takes precedence.
<string>Undue haste will hasten one's undoing. We must<lf>proceed with care.
<string>The Monster Field Guide is a collection of our<lf>findings based on monsters you have hunted.
<string>The information inside is quite detailed.<lf>I hope you'll find it useful.
<string>The Support Team has arrived, then? I'm relieved<lf>to know they are safe.
<string>As you can see, they're quite dedicated little<lf>workers. I'm sure they'll be happy to assist you.

<string>The leading theory is that Black Windrustlers are<lf>a subspecies, rather than a melanistic mutation.
<string>There are simply too many observed cases to write<lf>them off as spontaneous mutations.
<string>Perhaps it's selective pressure at work, to shed<lf>their bright orange for camouflage amid the Sandtide.
<string>Hymstrigians differ from Amstrigians not<lf>only in coloration, but quite notably in song.
<string>Their numbers are few, to the point of endangerment.<lf>But if a finer song yields a selective advantage...
<string>It's possible their numbers may rise, rather than<lf>decline. Certainly merits further study.
<string>At a glance, Azure Rufflizards seem a simple<lf>pigmentation variant of the Ember Rufflizard.
<string>But closer inspection reveals signs of a burgeoning<lf>subspecies beyond those simple coloration shifts.
<string>They may well still be in the throes of evolution.
<string>The Golden Hercudrome: variant of the Hercudrome,<lf>said to be the world's toughest insect.
<string>There were documented sightings in the New World.<lf>It seems they've found their place here, as well.
<string>Masters of any ecosystem they encounter... They've<lf>truly earned their title as the top dog of bugs.
<string>The glamorous, rainbow-shelled cousin of the<lf>Hercudrome—the Prism Hercudrome.
<string>As much as their coloring, they are defined by<lf>their three horns: more than the standard variant.
<string>Does the horn mutation yield a change in pigmenting,<lf>or is it...? Mm, a topic well worth mulling on.
<string>It is thought the Regal Jewel Scarab's flamboyant<lf>shell is a product of nutrients stockpiled as a larva.
<string>Because it draws on that store to grow, its quantity<lf>greatly affects the form its carapace takes.
<string>The moment the world's bug hunters catch wind<lf>of this one, they'll fly into a frenzy.
<string>As the name suggests, Curioshell Crabs are a<lf>cousin to the Florashell Crab. However...
<string>They do not share its practice of burrowing in the<lf>ground, suggesting they may be the older variant.
<string>And their wont for donning manmade objects indicates<lf>a strong influence from the lost civilization here.
<string>Dapperwing individuals with distinct coloration are<lf>classified as "Dazzlewings."
<string>The plumage is more lush and brightly pigmented—<lf>adaptations shown to provide a mating advantage.
<string>Beauty standards differ by species, yet here they<lf>clearly line up... A curious coincidence indeed.
<string>The way they dart across the evening desert like<lf>a shooting star... "Sandstar" is a truly fitting name.
<string>When alerted to danger by their keen hearing, they<lf>take off at a blinding pace, like a shooting star.
<string>Other species are known to exhibit similar traits...<lf>I'm eager to delve into any possible connections.
<string>The lives of Pillopods are inextricably entwined<lf>with this region's unique energy.
<string>An overexposure to that energy, however, will give<lf>rise to a variant, the Gillopod.
<string>A clear show of how this land's unique traits influence<lf>the life here, and perhaps a key to understanding it.
<string>Looking at a plump, round, snow-white Downy Crake,<lf>you'd never imagine the speed at which it runs.
<string>It lives in symbiosis with other monsters, so<lf>sightings are quite common, but actual <ITALIC>captures?</ITALIC>
<string>And yet here you've brought a Downy Crake to me!<lf>I cannot thank you enough, but I'll try: Thank you!
<string>The Petricanth... So it's here, as well. This is a<lf>major find for the field of paleogeology, as well.
<string>These sightings in the New World and the East will<lf>inform our theories of continental formation.
<string>...Sadly, the extreme rarity of these events has<lf>stymied any real research into the fish itself.
<string>In that sense, they represent a dream chased by a<lf>whole cohort of research scientists.
<string>Escunites may be soft-bodied mollusks, but their<lf>shells are exceptionally hard.
<string>Almost excessively so, really. Must be awfully<lf>cumbersome to move, dragging that thing around...
<string>Just what threats spurred them to evolve such an<lf>impregnable shelter?
<string>Grand Escunites are an even rarer white variant of an<lf>already rare species. I'm impressed you caught one.
<string>Is their lack of pigmentation a simple spontaneous<lf>mutation, or is it evolution's hand at work...?
<string>The research community is still hotly divided on<lf>the matter.
