<string>Hunter!
<string>You might need this!
<string>Throw it now!
<string>You're OK now.
<string>Hey!
<string>Hey, it's...it's OK. You're safe now.
<string>So much for this region being uninhabited...
<string>It must be a type of flightless Bird Wyvern...
<string>Y'sai...he's still in trouble...
<string>Y'sai?
<string>We were doing Seikret practice...<lf>But then it came...
<string>And my brother...he...
<string>What came? One of the things that was chasing<lf>you earlier?
<string>And your brother...where is he?
<string>He told me to run, and he stayed...
<string>Sounds like trouble, yeah?
<string>Can you tell us where he is?
<string>The Seikret. He knows Y'sai's scent.
<string>Let's find him.
<string>I'm with you.
<string>Everyone else focus on scouting for a camp site.
<string>Understood. Just send a signal if you need backup.
<string>We'll leave some supplies for you—<lf>I'll keep an eye on these two.
<string>We're moving out.
<string>Please...take these people to save Y'sai.
<string>We're counting on you.
<string>Come with me, OK?
<string>Don't worry, we'll be back soon!
<string>Be careful out there!
<string>See ya later!
<string>We should prepare a bit—just in case.
