<string>How's everything going? You keeping well stocked?<lf>Oilwell Basin's heat not baking your brains?
<string>Did my brothers seem like they're getting by OK?
<string>Azuz is such a lively place. You can hear them<lf>shouting from all the way out here.
<string>You can feel the heat of the<lf>villagers' passion from here.
<string>Making stuff, just for the joy of creation.<lf>That's the kind of place this village has always been.
<string>Wonder how this batch of Oricalcite's shaping up.
<string>I'm responsible for logistics and managing the<lf>stockpile here at the Azuz Base Camp. Pleasure.
<string>I'm so happy to be meeting new people here in the<lf>Forbidden Lands, I'm practically buzzing.
<string>I surveyed the environs, and it's a big change from<lf>the desert and forest. Need to stock wisely.
<string>I hear things are rough in the sands? Then you'd<lf>better top up your stock before you regret it.
<string>Moments like these are what the Guild<lf>and guys like me are for!
<string>That was a real treat to see... Glad I got posted<lf>here... Mm? What'd I see? Oh, uhhh, <ITALIC>y'know.</ITALIC> Lots.
<string>Even if the folks here don't understand, you<lf>really get it done.
<string>Hmm... We should probably be staying<lf>on guard, yeah?
<string>This long burn is going to dredge up old memories.
<string>If this keeps up, my whole stock's<lf>going to turn into jerky!
<string>I'm not worried. Azuz and its people are built<lf>tough. Past that, the Guild will handle it.
<string>You've sure been busy lately, huh? Seems like<lf>that's not changing soon...
<string>I feel like the Firespring has really fried my<lf>hair. Does it look frizzy to you? Be honest.
<string>I'm so glad I got posted to Azuz. I know I'll have<lf>to say goodbye to it someday, but still.
<string>This land isn't meant to be where we plant our<lf>bones, but I want to keep working here until then.
