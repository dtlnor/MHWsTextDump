<string>Helpful Hints: Chatacabra
<string>The Chatacabra's soft tongue is the place to strike; look for openings after their attacks or when they become tired. Destroying the ore stuck to their forelimbs will leave them wide open to attack. They roam a wide area, so environmental elements like falling boulders or Flashflies will be useful in taking them down.

<string>Helpful Hints: Quematrice
<string>Keep an eye on where flammable material settles on the ground to gauge how much a Quematrice's fire will spread. Since they rely on their tails to attack from a distance as well as to start blazes, a hunter can weaken this monster significantly by cutting it off.

<string>Helpful Hints: Lala Barina
<string>The paralytic effects of a single Lala Barina tuft is weak and not enough to subdue a hunter, but repeated contact should be avoided. The stinger on their abdomens make approaching from the rear a risky bet, but when tired the stinger will stay deployed and vulnerable. There are reports that when in terrain such as their nests where they hang from above, enough attacks will knock them down.

<string>Helpful Hints: Congalala
<string>The Stench from a Congalala is so rancid that healing items have no effect. But you can quickly dispel it with a deodorant or by evading in water. Those farts are also trouble, but a hunter might just spot an opportunity if they watch carefully. Congalala are also known to use any breath type—a trick some have attributed to the black mushrooms they're seen digging up.

<string>Helpful Hints: Balahara
<string>The interior of a Balahara's mouth is a soft target that can be exploited if you strike right after it expels mucus. Since they rely on heightened hearing while submerged, sonic bombs or screamer pods—obtainable from Baunos—are highly effective. Sometimes the large monster you're hunting will get sucked into a Balahara sand pit...but there's nothing stopping you from going after it.

<string>Helpful Hints: Alpha Doshaguma
<string>When Doshaguma are low on health, their wounds open exposing a weak point. They'll grow more aggressive, though, so beware of counterattacks. Their stomachs are exposed when rising to their hind legs, which is a relatively soft target and potential weak point. Use their mobility to lure them into rock and vine traps.

<string>Helpful Hints: Uth Duna
<string>Seeing as an Uth Duna's veil reduces attack damage, the first order of business is to dispel it quickly. It will fall away once it loses enough water, but that's not entirely good news; without the veil weighing the monster down, an Uth Duna will become more agile and aggressive. You can dodge their wave with some creative evading, or by using things like wedge beetles to escape upward.

<string>Helpful Hints: Rompopolo
<string>Hunters must be wary of the Rompopolo's poisonous explosions. Gas sacs can be found all over their bodies; the anterior ones contain poison, while the posterior sacs are for explosions. If you see one start to swell, strike it to shrink it back down. When fighting in oilsilt, the blasts will kick up rubble that can act as stable footholds.

<string>Helpful Hints: Nerscylla
<string>Come prepared to defend against the poison, sleep, and binding effects of a Nerscylla's webbing. While its powerful pincers are quite dangerous, they can and should be targeted as a weakness, provided they are approached correctly. The Gypceros hides draped on a Nerscylla's back are resistant to thunder but susceptible to fire—qualities that are reversed once the hide is destroyed.

<string>Helpful Hints: Hirabami
<string>Hirabami can remain aloft as they maneuver skillfully between the ground and the sky. You'll need to watch out for those tail claws, but handle an attack well to turn it into a counterstrike opportunity. Destroying the membrane on their necks will lower their guards while aloft. Furthermore, you can target the membrane wound to knock them out of the air, making this a prime target.

<string>Helpful Hints: Ajarakan
<string>Approaching an Ajarakan's extreme heat will sap your health, so use cool drinks or Chillmantle Bugs to counteract it. Normal ammo and arrows will melt if you try to pierce their molten carapaces, so you must use heat-resistant equipment or hit them with Watermoss to cool them down first. Continuous friction will cause their body temperature to rise, but soften their outer shells.

<string>Helpful Hints: Nu Udra
<string>Each of a Nu Udra's many unique tentacles can be severed. But watch out when they get angry and burst into flame. You can douse any parts that are burning with watermoss— a recommended strategy, since it will leave the monster weakened. A Nu Udra's soft body allows them to slip through crevasses and move in surprising ways, so be careful not to let them get the jump on you.

<string>Helpful Hints: Guardian Arkveld
<string>Guardian Arkveld use retractable chainblades on their wings to attack, which can absorb and release energy, as well as convert the energy to the dragon element and discharge it, which will trigger an explosion of the same element if it comes into contact with Wylkrystals. The crystals formed by their attacks will explode from elemental interference, making Slinger ammo effective.

<string>Helpful Hints: Jin Dahaad
<string>Every part of Jin Dahaad's massive body is capable of powerful freezing attacks. Diminish their offensive capabilities by attacking the ridges that they use for cooling. The largest ridges on their back are particularly powerful and should be destroyed, but the hide there is very tough unless the other ridges are dealt with first.

<string>Helpful Hints: Guardian Ebony Odogaron
<string>Guardian Ebony Odogaron are most notable for their developed bleeding-inducing claws and dexterous tails, both of which carry Guardian energy that can trigger explosions. If their dragon-element attacks connect with Wylkrystals, it will cause an explosion of the same element. However, since the crystals are triggered through elemental interference Slinger ammo can also be used effectively.

<string>Due to their predatory nature, you can expect Xu Wu to attack Guardians inside their habitat. When one exposes its mouth, that means a deadly attack is coming, but with a powerful blow, you might be able to topple the creature.

<string>Helpful Hints: Zoh Shia
<string>Zoh Shia share the same basic traits of other Guardians. The crystals on their wings and heads can be destroyed to deplete their energy. They will regrow, but they'll be easier to destroy after the first time. The crystals they create will detonate if they take elemental damage, but a talented hunter can use elemental Slinger ammo and smart maneuvering to make good use of them.

<string>Helpful Hints: Yian Kut-Ku
<string>The Yian Kut-Ku's superior hearing comes with great sensitivity to sound. A loud noise is sometimes all it takes to stop them in their tracks, reason enough to make liberal use of sonic bombs. But there's a catch: once a Yian Kut-Ku comes back to itself, it's going to be really flocking mad and come at a hunter even more viciously than before.

<string>Helpful Hints: Guardian Fulgur Anjanath
<string>A hunter must watch out for a Guardian Fulgur Anjanath's sparks and teeth. While their lightning attacks alone are a threat, their maws infused with Guardian energy will cause wide-range explosions. Try to topple one by aggressively targeting its legs. The crystals that form from their attacks will explode through elemental interference, so Slinger ammo can also be effective.

<string>Gore Magala will use its wings to attack anything it detects with its sensory scales without abandon. If a hunter contracts the Frenzy, their natural healing will decrease and any damage taken will increase, but an experienced hunter knows to keep attacking to raise their metabolism before the virus takes to avoid negative effects. Target the head to put a stop to Gore Magala's Frenzy.

<string>Blangonga use snowy ground to their advantage for extra mobility, and can summon other Blangos to gang up on unwary hunters. Use extra caution when they're angry, because they can direct the whole pack at a chosen target. Watch out for that freezing breath, too. Destroying a Blangonga's tusks is believed to undermine its authority with the other Blangos, disrupting their teamwork.

<string>The more energy this monster absorbs, the more ferocious its attacks become. Once it fills its energy tanks, its chainblades will sweep out to attack an even wider area. You can weaken its energy reserves by attacking the wings. Flooding them with continuous elemental attacks will eventually overload the organs, forcing the monster out of its enhanced state.
