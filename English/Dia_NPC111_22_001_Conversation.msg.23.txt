<string>How's it going? Staying dry, Hunter? No face-<lf>planting in puddles and chugging red water?
<string>How about my bros? Look like they're doing OK?
<string>I love the forest. And new sights. Not mad at<lf>a bit of rain, either.
<string>I don't mind a <ITALIC>bit</ITALIC> of rain... You can<lf>have too much of a good thing, you know! Ha ha ha!
<string>River's running high out there. Watch your step.
<string>Salutations! I'm the guy they've got running<lf>provisions here at the Forest Base Camp.
<string>Place is a bit on the gloomy side, but that just<lf>means we gotta make our own sunshine, right?
<string>I was getting reports about provisions sprouting<lf>legs and walking off. Must've been the locals.
<string>What was it, again? Woodies? Wuddles?
<string>I hope Nata's doing OK... There's no way his<lf>head's straight after seeing that thing again.
<string>Hey there, Hunter. You're looking radiant today.<lf>I'm blinded here!
<string>...What? Fabius is here? In the Forbidden<lf>Lands? ...R-Really?
<string>The humidity's been through the roof lately.<lf>I'm really struggling to keep my stock dry.
<string>What do you suppose this rain's trying<lf>to wash away?
<string>Hey, I just want to cheer you on for putting<lf>in the work in the middle of that downpour.
<string>For all my grumbling, I don't mind the rain.<lf>This place probably needs it, too.
<string>We get Wudwuds poking around the Base Camp here<lf>and there...
<string>They're cute, huh? The little gremlins.
<string>Alright! Time to get provisioning, come rain<lf>or...worse rain.
