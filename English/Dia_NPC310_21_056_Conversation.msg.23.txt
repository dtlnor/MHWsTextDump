<string>Work going well, I hope?<lf>Be sure you remember to rest.
<string>If you're heading out on an investigation,<lf>I take it your Palico is, too?
<string>I guess sticking with their hunter is their<lf>whole job. Sounds like tough work.
<string>Welcome, Hunter. What can I help you with today?
<string>Everyone on the Support Team is working hard<lf>to help the investigation however we can.
<string>I'm not the strongest Felyne around. Desk work<lf>always matched my personality better.
<string>That's quite the storm out there. I don't want<lf>to step outside on days like this.
<string>When the wind's this strong, my fur goes<lf>all crazy...
<string>It's a pleasure to meet you, Hunter. I lead the<lf>Support Team. I look forward to working with you!
<string>There should be more of us here, but we're running<lf>a bit behind because the others are running late.
<string>I'm a bit worried...
<string>If you're looking for the latest mews and<lf>special deliveries, I'm the Felyne to talk to.
<string>Oh! Hunter! Thank you so much for bailing out<lf>the Support Team!
<string>Thanks to you, they're all safe and accounted for.<lf>I'm really grateful!
<string>I heard the camp was attacked. I guess you have<lf>to be careful no matter where you are.
<string>Ahh, this feels amazing! The air's so crisp and<lf>clear, too.
<string>I don't mind the outdoors on days like this.<lf>...Still probably won't, though.
<string>Those sandstorms are scary, huh? If I'm not<lf>careful, I'll get sent flying.
<string>You take care not to go airborne either, Hunter.
<string>The investigation's making good progress, huh?<lf>It's all thanks to your hard work, Hunter.
<string>We'll put our heads together here and think<lf>on how we can support you even more.
<string>A big part of the investigation may have ended,<lf>but I guess the work is still ongoing, huh?
<string>Well, here's to continuing our<lf>work together, Hunter!
<string>I haven't seen Fabius in years.
<string>He looks a little scary, but you won't meet<lf>a nicer guy.
<string>...Seems like everyone's fur is standing on end.
<string>I'm also feeling restless. I wonder why.
<string>I'm glad the weather is back to normal!
<string>I like a dust bath as much as the next Felyne,<lf>but I'm not so fond of getting sandblasted.
<string>Gosh, Hunter, you come back looking even more<lf>seasoned with every job you finish.
<string>You're so reliable!
<string>Now that I've adjusted to the job here, I feel<lf>like I'm using my time more effectively.
<string>Maybe I'll start reading more.
