<string>We need to find Nata. I'll get the others.
<string>Be careful.
<string>(something clatters)
<string>Nata! Tasheen!
<string>You're OK!
<string>We were so worried.
<string>We hid in the cocoons.
<string>It tricks the Guardians, at least for a while.
<string>In these? Wow.
<string>I am once again in your debt. Thank you.
<string>The strength you possess...
<string>It is...
<string>You saw it, right? What Arkveld was doing?
<string>Yes, it was feeding. It's unprecedented.
<string>Where did it learn this behavior?
<string>Can it still be considered a Guardian?
<string>And if not, what is it in danger of becoming?
<string>You're certain this has never happened before?
<string>No. At least, not that I'm aware of...
<string>Wait...
<string>The Allhearken!
<string>She would know more than I.
<string>The Allhearken?
<string>Yes, she is somewhat of an advisor to the Keepers.
<string>She "hearkens" information from far reaches, and<lf>has amassed knowledge from across history.
<string>Where can we find her?
<string>In a village some distance from here.
<string>But a blizzard and a giant monster there makes<lf>the path treacherous.
<string>No Keeper dares make the journey.
<string>Let's go.
<string>We've come this far.
<string>Don't be foolish! You do not know what awaits you!
<string>Tasheen.
<string>They can do it. I know they can.
<string>Even so...
<string>I'm going with them.
<string>If the Allhearken knows what Arkveld is becoming,<lf>I need to know.
<string>Please take care of him for me.
<string>And may your courage bring us the answers we seek.
<string>We gotta prepare if we're gonna take on the cold.
<string>Agreed. Let's regroup at the Keepers' village.
