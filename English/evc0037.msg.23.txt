<string>You're not saying that—
<string>Yes.
<string>Our ancestors succeeded in creating life—<lf>creatures they called...Guardians.
<string>To this day, they hibernate in these cocoons.
<string>You've got to be kidding me.
<string>They are the legacy passed on to us.
<string>What?
<string>Seriously?
<string>The Guardians were created with several<lf>unique properties.
<string>One—they don't eat.
<string>Wyveria's energy is their sole requirement<lf>to function.
<string>Thus they have no need for predation.
<string>That explains the behavior of the Doshaguma<lf>and Rathalos we saw.
<string>Two—
<string>they live indefinitely, and therefore<lf>have no need to reproduce.
<string>They don't die of natural causes?
<string>Not as long as they continue to<lf>consume the Wyvern Milk.
<string>Ever since Wyveria fell,
<string>the Guardians stayed dormant...until recent years,<lf>when they began to awaken.
<string>This place is rich in Wyvern Milk.
<string>They have all the sustenance they could ever need...
<string>Yet Arkveld escaped to the outside world.
<string>The Guardians were modeled after<lf>existing monsters, enhancing their traits...
<string>And it seems that Arkveld was singled out.
<string>Because its species was extinct.
<string>I don't know if that's the only reason,<lf>but yes...it was different.
<string>Arkveld awakened, attacked the village...and fled.
<string>Despite the loss of many lives...
<string>Our only option is to continue watching<lf>over the Guardians still here.
<string>It is the destiny that we have inherited from—
<string>Tasheen, I...
<string>Out there, I saw many things.
<string>Many people, creatures—<lf>all living life to the fullest...
<string>"Life"?
<string>Is that what you call this?
<string>Constructed husks that can't even eat...
<string>Locked away when they're no longer needed?
<string>Arkveld...
<string>All it wanted was to be free!
<string>And I...I...
<string>I don't know which of us is worse...
<string>Nata.
<string>If things were different, you wouldn't<lf>have this unique perspective.
<string>But you do.
<string>I'm sorry. I...shouldn't take it out on you.
<string>You really do take after your father.
<string>Nata, his role among our people was<lf>particularly important.
<string>That pendant has a very unique function.
<string>The energy of Wyveria—
<string>Come. You will see.
<string>I thought they didn't need to eat!
<string>Nata! Tasheen!
<string>We have to find them!
<string>What!? Are you nuts!?
