<string>Ooh, listen to this! Another great idea popped<lf>into my head.
<string>Yeah? Let me know if you need me to get materials again.
<string>Thanks, partner! In that case, I need Flashflies.
<string>Flashflies? I see where this is going. Unlike the<lf>monsters, who won't be seeing much of anything...
<string>Heh heh, bingo! I knew you'd get it.
<string>You can catch one with your capture net, same as<lf>last time. Thanks!
<string>Thanks for nabbing those sparkly Flashflies<lf>for me.
<string>I'll rig this one up, too, so you can use it<lf>whenever you decide.
<string>It can make flying monsters drop from the sky and<lf>silence roars...very useful for making openings!
<string>Sounds like a nice tool to have around. Thanks.
<string>Eh heh heh... What can I say? Offering top-tier<lf>support is a Palico's job.
<string>You nabbed them in a flash! Hehe. I'll check them out<lf>back at camp!
