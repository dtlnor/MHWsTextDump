<string>The forest findings are fluffsome, pillowish.<lf>Some have a pleasantful squish.
<string>Mmm, the red mushrooms are big, big squishy.<lf>Most splendiferous.
<string>Take pink fur from only large ones. Fur without<lf>largeness is unsatisfactaceous.
<string>Ancestrous Wudwuds left many words. But words<lf>not spoken get lost-forgot.
<string>Trading words must never be lost-forgot. Cannot<lf>let that happen. No, let us make more!
<string>That fur is the best of splenditude. A most<lf>pleasantful feel.
<string>The sky-falling water will make red land.
<string>Is the red from the Wyveer watra purefires? We not<lf>purefires no more, so we not know.
<string>We stay hidey-safe in the woods. Big things<lf>can't find here.
<string>And if a big thing see you? Toss all of your<lf>clothy-wearings and run.
<string>The sky falls...
<string>We Wudwuds will gather here. The sky has<lf>fallen out.
<string>The sky is back in place, so we hold festivation.
<string>Make fire and enjoy warmings. Roast the<lf>harvestings with delightsome flavor.
<string>Let us go out into forest. Make walkings.<lf>The time is now.
<string>We repay our friends with deals most generish.<lf>Make tradings with the Wudwuds anytime.
<string>A big frightsome thing comes to the woods.<lf>It can't be stopped.
<string>If you meet across with Rove, give listenings<lf>to his story-tales. He will be big delighted.
<string>Do as your pleasings here. Ah, but, if you see<lf>a Wudwud in botherous trouble, help.
<string>Big friend of Wudwuds. Your workings were most<lf>satisfactaceous.
<string>Scratchy-rough... My fur is scratchy-rough.<lf>Poor weather, very botherous.
<string>The sky fell out. Dangerful, big dangerful! Best<lf>you made swift returnings to your puny hovel.
<string>Entire Wudwud forest was in danger most<lf>precaritous. Saved because of we copper-ate.
<string>You has our biggest gratisfaction.
<string>Squishy...fluffsome...smootherous...crisping...<lf>Ahh, even just thinking on them is delightsome!
<string>Be not disasterous, friend. We continue to make<lf>many tradings.
<string>Is beyond the forest pillowy-fluffsome? Or maybe<lf>scratchy-rough?
