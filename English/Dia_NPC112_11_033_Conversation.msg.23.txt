<string>Oh, um, hello...
<string>Looks like we need a little more heat. Oh! Um,<lf>sorry, excuse me, I have to go fetch a Wylkdrop.
<string>To truly understand cheese, you must learn<lf>all its likes and dislikes. Watch. Observe.
<string>Though it's up to the cheese if they like you back<lf>enough to cooperate...
<string>Cheese is my life. Sometimes it's the only thing<lf>that gets me out of bed in the morning.
<string>Hello, traveler. It seems we meet again.
<string>Good to see you again. How's your work going?
<string>Today is going to be a lot of physical labor. Just<lf>think of the cheese...keep your eye on the prize...
<string>Everyone's really excited lately. Makes sense,<lf>with the Season of Plenty and all.
<string>It's hard to keep up with their energy though...<lf>Cheese is a lot easier of a companion sometimes...
<string>I was so desperate to get all the cheese to<lf>safety when the Sandtide hit...
<string>I didn't have the time to think about anything<lf>else. Don't worry though, the cheese is safe.
