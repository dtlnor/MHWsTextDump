<string>Oh, um, hello...
<string>Looks like we need a little more heat. Oh! Um,<lf>sorry, excuse me, I have to go fetch a Wylkdrop.
<string>To truly understand cheese, you must learn<lf>all its likes and dislikes. Watch. Observe.
<string>Though it's up to the cheese if it likes<lf>you back enough to cooperate...
<string>Cheese is my life. Sometimes it's the only thing<lf>that gets me out of bed in the morning.
<string>Hello, traveler. It seems we meet again.
<string>Good to see you again. How's your work going?
<string>Today is going to be a lot of physical labor. Just<lf>think of the cheese...keep your eye on the prize...
<string>Everyone's really excited lately. Makes sense,<lf>with the season of Plenty and all.
<string>It's hard to keep up with their energy though...<lf>Cheese is a lot easier of a companion sometimes...
<string>I was so desperate to get all the cheese to<lf>safety when the Sandtide hit...
<string>I didn't have the time to think about anything<lf>else. Don't worry though, the cheese is safe.
<string>You're going to the forest? Oh, that's, um. I see.
<string>The Sandtide again... Need to get<lf>everything ready... Ugh...again.
<string>The cheese and I are very grateful to you, traveler.<lf>Thank you so much!
<string>None of us imagined the Doshaguma would come<lf>to the village.
<string>You, um... You can do some pretty<lf>amazing things, huh?
<string>A bit embarrassing that I've been yammering on<lf>about dumb things like cheese to someone so cool...
<string>The Sandtide came so suddenly, it was do or die.<lf>...I had to get the cheese indoors!
<string>It's so nice outside today...
<string>You know what? I've been working hard.<lf>I deserve a little break. Yeah. Definitely.
<string>Oh, I'm so sorry! I didn't catch that.
<string>I was just thinking about my to-do list for<lf>tomorrow... There's so much to do...
<string>Actually, um... If it's all right to ask, does<lf>the cheese taste different lately?
<string>I don't suppose you ever really get a day off, huh?<lf>Chasing after monsters. Getting chased yourself...
<string>That sure does sound exhausting.
<string>Hello! I want to thank you. The other villagers have<lf>started coming to talk to me more now.
<string>Apparently, they saw us talking and were surprised,<lf>that I, uh, could... But uh, yeah! Thanks!
