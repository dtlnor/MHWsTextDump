<string>I don't like this place at all...
<string>Some are rotting...
<string>Some fresh...
<string>Did it—all of them?
<string>(noisy chewing sounds)
<string>There.
<string>This isn't predatory behavior... It's destructive.
<string>We can't let this go on.
<string>There's no other way...
<string>What do you mean?
<string>I'm sorry.
<string>Arkveld has become a threat to the continued<lf>existence of this ecosystem.
<string>It...must be put down.
<string>No.
<string>Please. Please!
<string>Nata.
<string>If anyone should be angry, it's me.
<string>And I hate that it happened...
<string>But this is the first thing it ever<lf>got to decide for itself.
<string>To be free, to live strong...
<string>Please...
<string>Don't do this. I'm begging you.
<string>It can't control itself.
<string>The path we must take is clear.
<string>For the continued preservation of this ecosystem...
<string>The Guild authorizes you to slay<lf>the Guardian Arkveld.
<string>Acknowledged.
<string>No, please!
<string>There has to be another way!
<string>It finally got its chance to live!
