<string>My word...
<string>Is this a Lala Barina floret?
<string>A Lala Barina?
<string>It's a monster, a temnoceran. Smell.
<string>This is a very distinct paralytic poison.
<string>I must find more.
<string>I knew it. Definitely a Lala Barina.
<string>Based on the scent, this one's paralytic properties<lf>are on the lower end...
<string>Look, another one!
<string>The color hasn't faded...
<string>We must be near its nest.
<string>This is just the sweet intellectual nectar I thirsted for!
<string>Why are you so AMAZING, forest?
<string>A bit eccentric, but he sure is useful.
<string>Uh, he's also a bit missing!
<string>Don't tell me he wandered off alone...
<string>There!
<string>Looks like he's incapacitated.
<string>Touch that nest and we'll be next.
<string>But...
<string>We can't leave him.
<string>Back me up.
<string>This isn't the time for a nap!
<string>I'll take it from here!
<string>Counting on it!
