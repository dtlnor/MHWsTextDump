<string>We use Wyvern Milk to regulate the temperature.<lf>The ideal heat for comfort, for growing crops...
<string>Elemental manipulation is the basic foundation<lf>of Wyvern Milk use. This is a component of that.
<string>It can also be used to manage nutrition.<lf>Another core fundamental, really.
<string>Just how big is the world outside?<lf>How many people are out there?
<string>"Horizon"? "Skyline"...?<lf>I'm sorry, I don't understand.
<string>You people from the outside are all so passionate.<lf>So curious to have your questions answered.
<string>I still struggle to imagine what such learning may<lf>bring. What comes after those answers...
<string>We trusted that Nata was alive...<lf>That was our only hope.
<string>We were powerless when it attacked, but we were<lf>at least able to safeguard Nata's escape.
<string>At least I know <ITALIC>that</ITALIC> was no mistake.

<string>I hear you mean to visit the Allhearken?
<string>But the road is frozen shut, and the path<lf>is patrolled by large monsters.
<string>I was quite shocked! No sooner had you left than<lf>more outsiders arrived!
<string>And now I hear they've unblocked the passage<lf>leading to the Allhearken's peak!
<string>It was a pair of gentlemen. One cheerful young<lf>man, and an older, scary-eyed fellow.
<string>They were gone before I had the chance<lf>to thank them.
<string>I just... I want to know what you all will do.
<string>I believe, now as ever, that there is only one<lf>path forward. But am I mistaken?
<string>Arkveld's feeding is another enigma to reckon<lf>with. I feel quite lost...
<string>It has been some time, visitor. I'm glad to see<lf>you looking well.
<string>As for us, we're much the same as ever.
<string>Is Nata doing well? Is he learning well?
<string>The Wyvern Milk temperature regulation has been<lf>strangely erratic, lately.
<string>It feels the usual calm has returned.
<string>I don't know quite how I ought to feel about<lf>Arkveld, now.
<string>Had our ancestors not created it, had it not attacked,<lf>had Nata not fled... You would not be here.
<string>Had any step along the way gone differently, good<lf>and bad alike, we would never have arrived here.
<string>I've grown curious to see the world outside.
<string>I think I'd like to leave, someday, and see this<lf>"desert" Nata's spoken about.
<string>To see the many monsters that aren't Guardians.
