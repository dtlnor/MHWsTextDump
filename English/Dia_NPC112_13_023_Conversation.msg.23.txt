<string>Maki's sure fired up again today.
<string>I love it. That kind of energy is infectious.
<string>Proud of you for giving it a hundred percent today.<lf>Mm? Oh, just talking to myself.
<string>You giving it <ITALIC>your</ITALIC> best?<lf>Then I'm proud of you, too.
<string>When it comes to oil harvesting, you won't find<lf>anyone better than us. Won't even come close!
<string>We've got a custom-built tool that exploits all the<lf>traits that normally make extraction such a pain.
<string>It's based on an old design, but the current<lf>chief's made some key revisions.
<string>Gushing fire, and a raucous crowd.<lf>Now <ITALIC>this</ITALIC> is a Firespring.
<string>We've done all we can. Any shortcomings will just<lf>be a lesson for next time.
<string>All that's left is to enjoy the festival!
<string>Wonder how the other tribes are looking. I know<lf>for a fact we worked as hard as either of them.
<string>Why won't the boss let me go harvest oil?<lf>Doesn't seem to care about the festival, either.
<string>He didn't used to be like this.
<string>It's like we're <ITALIC>trying</ITALIC> to get looked<lf>down on by the other tribes. ...I hate this.
<string>I hear you chased off that monster. That's wild.
<string>Used to be we'd go out for oil, monsters or not.
<string>Sure, we saw a lot more injuries back then, but<lf>it was like a badge of honor, y'know?
<string>Have you seen that guy who's been ogling the<lf>Everforge this whole time? What's <ITALIC>that</ITALIC> about?
<string>He came here with you guys, right?<lf>...His eyes scare me.
<string>What's going on? Why is this happening!?
<string>What'll happen with the festival now? And to us?
<string>I kinda lost hope for a minute, there... I'm glad<lf>Maki's efforts paid off.
<string>Heh, look at her, she's beaming.
<string>Some of the Stonefolk guys have started peeking<lf>in, lately. Wonder what's got into them.
<string>It's almost time for the Firespring. I always<lf>get antsy around this time.
<string>Things feel different this time around, though...
<string>There's no way this is normal.
<string>Reminds me of what happened<lf>to the Everforge last time...
<string>I've got no clue what's making the Firespring last<lf>like this, but that's no excuse to just sit around.
<string>The Black Flame again...
<string>And with the Firespring problem still<lf>going on, too... What next?
<string>Seems we owe you another one, traveler. Thanks.
<string>If stuff like this is gonna keep happening, I guess<lf>we'll need to change the way we do things here...
<string>Seeing Maki bust her buns always gets me fired up,<lf>too. Can't go falling behind!
<string>...She's not the only one here trying to change<lf>things for the better.
<string>The Stonefolk have been coming over a lot recently.
<string>It feels like... Like we didn't really know<lf>a thing about each other till now.
