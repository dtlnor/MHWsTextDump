<string>Let me show you to the chiefs.
<string>Quite a setup.
<string>You can say that again.
<string>I see not all the forges are in use.
<string>Good to see ya, friend!
<string>Thanks for coming!
<string>It's been a while.
<string>What a nice surprise! You'll have<lf>to stay for the Festival.
<string>Let me introduce you.
<string>These are Kunafa's guests.<lf>They are travelers from the West.
<string>Pleasure to meet you.
<string>Well then, that makes you our guests as well.
<string>Welcome, travelers!<lf>I present you...Azuz, the Everforge.
<string>As you can see, we have a long history of craftsmaking.
<string>My name is Aida, chief of the Bonefolk.
<string>If you need monster materials crafted,<lf>we're the best there is.
<string>I am Dogard. I lead the Stone Tribe.
<string>If it's rocks or minerals, we got you covered.
<string>It is SUCH a pleasure!
<string>I'll take the grand tour, please!
<string>You lucked out, you're just in time for<lf>the Firespring Festival.
<string>That we'll win.
<string>Sure you will.
<string>They ignite the Everforge during the festival.<lf>It is quite a formidable force.
<string>There is plenty o' time before things kick off.
<string>So please, go ahead and make yourselves at home.
<string>Take a load off. Relax.
<string>Thank you so much. You're very kind.
<string>Show our guests around.
<string>This will do nicely.
<string>Hey!
<string>I want to go observe the Bonefolk. It's fine, right?
<string>I want to go check out this Everforge myself.
<string>I wish I could doppelganger myself<lf>so I can see it all at once!
<string>I have business with the Oilfolk's chief.
<string>He's held the position for a long time, countless years,<lf>so his knowledge must run pretty far back.
<string>Then he might have heard of the Keepers.
<string>Follow me.
<string>Just forget it, boss! I hate you!
<string>Wait! I'm coming with you!
<string>I hope we didn't come at a bad time.
<string>The girl, she is one of the Oilfolk...<lf>I hope it's nothing serious.
