<string>Most regrettable. Had we been able to decipher the<lf>research logs, we might have stopped Arkveld's attack.
<string>No, that thought was our mistake in the first place.
<string>A question: are you the descendant of those who<lf>departed?
<string>Why do you hold this notion of opposing the<lf>monsters, and why have you passed it on?
<string>The Wyvern's Wakening is a time of heightened Wyvern<lf>Milk output. The substance surges through all regions.
<string>That is contrasted by the Wyvern's Tranquility,<lf>when output dwindles. So it is written.
<string>Mm. Some business with us unenlightened, outsider?
<string>I had long expected this time would come...
<string>No. A falsehood, that. I never wished to imagine<lf>the day our world would shatter.
<string>But that, too, is false. Our world<lf>was already broken on that day.
<string>This archive holds the Keepers' research. Our<lf>forebears' wisdom and their secrets sleep here.
<string>Though none remain who can<lf>understand the bulk of it, now.
<string>The Allhearken? We have not paid her a visit in<lf>some time.
<string>The frozen roads, the village's destruction... Our<lf>way is to simply accept such obstructions.
<string>We claim it a matter of ancient law, throw up our<lf>hands, and blithely abandon our duty.
<string>And yet we speak of duty so fervently...<lf>A bitter irony.
<string>Stay or go, whatever you decide amounts to but<lf>a blink in the grand sweep of time.
<string>Zoh Shia. Of course it appears in the records here.
<string>It was made of extremely unique monster cells.<lf>A Guardian dubbed "the Savior."
<string>It was used in ancient times, only once. It ran<lf>amok, and fell to slumber, never to wake again.
<string>So, this is a hunter...
<string>The records cannot tell us what we must do now.
<string>A thought only just struck me. Perhaps we are<lf>to leave a record for ourselves?
<string>We watched over a charge unchanging for a millennium,<lf>only to learn now that nothing is unchanging.
<string>The Dragontorch we thought eternal is surely no<lf>exception.
<string>Perhaps we must all learn from Nata's example.
<string>Every vessel will one day see its shattering.
<string>Our forebears created a vessel unbreakable. But<lf>life is not a thing to be held captive forever.
<string>The Keepers, too, are a part of life, and now face<lf>a shattering. Perhaps it is our time to hatch.
<string>Whatever may come, my love of research will remain.
