<string>Hunter, I...
<string>Olivia said Nata showed "resolve"... But I'm not<lf>so sure that's what Nata's strength really is.
<string>Hey, be sure to check in on him, yeah?<lf>He must be feeling lots of things right now.
<string>You're a hunter. I'm a handler.<lf>We know what needs to be done here.
<string>Each day, each decision, all we can do is push past<lf>any tears or doubts to do what we believe is best.
<string>If this is your choice, I have no reason to object.
<string>I'm counting on you. Save these people, Hunter.
<string>I'll follow the path I think is right. I only ask<lf>that you do the same.
<string>Ecological shifts in every region of the Forbidden<lf>Lands at once... The implications are dire.
<string>I want more time. But there <ITALIC>is</ITALIC> no time. Our jobs<lf>are always a nonstop barrage of judgment calls.
<string>Regardless, I want you to come back safe.<lf>Promise me that.
<string>Ugh, what a waste. They never thought to leave the<lf>design of their Dragontorch to posterity?
<string>Once you lose that technology, it could take<lf>centuries to claw it back.
<string>And even that's a big "if." Most of the time,<lf>it's gone for good. That goes for more than just tech.
<string>Well, my mission here's shot!
<string>Hunter, if we don't stop the Dragontorch,<lf>Zoh Shia will awaken...right?
<string>And if it does, terrifying things might happen.
<string>This is my job as a Keeper.<lf>It's what I'm supposed to do.
<string>Will you come with me and help me do it?
<string>Of course, let's go.
<string>I need a little more time.
<string>Thanks...
<string>OK, I understand.
