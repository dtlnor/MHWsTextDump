<string>Something about the atmosphere here feels familiar.<lf>I think it reminds me of the western hub.
<string>I wonder if places where hunters gather always<lf>have a similar aura, no matter where they are.
<string>Maybe that's just their nature.
<string>Lotta is in charge of the Grand Hub's<lf>Quest Counter.
<string>She's incredible at multitasking.
<string>The Grand Hub is where the expedition team<lf>goes to exchange information.
<string>If you listen, you'll hear their voices<lf>even from here.
<string>The Wounded Hollow is where especially<lf>tough monsters gather. So stay vigilant.
<string>It's amazing that a person's voice can have<lf>such a profound effect on others.
<string>I'm trying not to cry, but I'm not sure I can<lf>hold back the tears.
<string>I wonder how their prayers developed<lf>such song-like qualities.
