<string>Hunter, we have to do what they tell us.

<string>Something about the atmosphere here feels familiar.<lf>I think it reminds me of the western hub.
<string>I wonder if places where hunters gather always<lf>have a similar aura, no matter where they are.
<string>Maybe that's just their nature.
<string>Lotta is in charge of the Grand Hub's<lf>Quest Counter.
<string>She's incredible at multitasking.
<string>The Grand Hub is where the expedition team<lf>goes to exchange information.
<string>If you listen, you'll hear their voices<lf>even from here.
<string>The Wounded Hollow is where especially<lf>tough monsters gather. So stay vigilant.
<string>It's amazing that a person's voice can have<lf>such a profound effect on others.
<string>I'm trying not to cry, but I'm not sure I can<lf>hold back the tears.
<string>I wonder how their prayers developed<lf>such song-like qualities.

<string>What we've just gleaned about the true nature of the<lf>Dragontorch is unprecedented, even for the Academy.
<string>Still, what's more important is that everyone is safe,<lf>including Rove. For that, I'm eternally grateful.
<string>So, the Frenzy Virus was responsible for the release<lf>of excess energy from the Dragontorch after all.
<string>With such an event, I find it hard to believe no other<lf>anomalies occurred in this delicate ecosystem.
<string>We should probably continue our investigation of the<lf>other regions, just to be sure.
<string>Supposing we do find Arkveld at our destination...
<string>and it turns out to truly be a natural-born creature,<lf>a product of overcoming Guardian nature...
<string>Provided Erik's speculation is correct, we may be<lf>faced with a difficult decision.
<string>Nata, you, and I... We've been watching how Arkveld<lf>has adapted and evolved all this time.
<string>I believe we should see this through to the very end.
<string>Nata has really gotten used to his new role in survey<lf>support. It has me thinking about his next steps...
<string>Eventually, it might be good for him to gain more<lf>experience by working with other units.
<string>It's easy to forget during times like this, but we've been<lf>presented with a once in a lifetime opportunity here.
<string>Even now, not a single person on the research team<lf>has expressed interest in returning to the West.
<string>Perhaps we all feel like there's something particular<lf>about these lands that we just can't leave alone.

<string>As Professor Fabius put it, "We must be cognizant<lf>of the fact that Gogmazios dwell in this land."
<string>"We must keep a sharp eye on the Oilwell Basin<lf>and watch for any new anomalies."
<string>Perhaps we should try to be more cognizant<lf>of the elder dragon's place in this land.
<string>It could better our understanding of<lf>the region's history.
