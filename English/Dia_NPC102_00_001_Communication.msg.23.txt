<string>This profession really makes you realize how difficult<lf>it is to pass knowledge on to future generations.
<string>What drove that home for me was finding a report on<lf>elder dragons at the Academy posing as a picture book.
<string>There were other things too, like secrets in diary<lf>excerpts, scattered pages that I pieced together...
<string>A report disguised as an encyclopedia of New World<lf>flora, and one as a collection of cooking recipes.
<string>Most of those handler reports concealed the names<lf>of the hunters involved.
<string>I think that was done to protect them.
<string>It's been many years now since I fell in love<lf>with things of ages past.
<string>They're just so captivating, like that<lf>late-anthroduodecimic groveling idol.
<string>Or the austral ritual bronze cauldron with a face on it.<lf>I call him Gonzo, by the way.
<string>I can't tell you how much I adore them. I hope I get<lf>a chance to give a lecture on them someday.
<string>Ever since I started studying cultural anthropology, I see<lf>that "normal" is different in different parts of the world.
<string>My younger self was convinced I'd be able to accept<lf>anything I encountered.
<string>But it turns out I wasn't strong enough or detached enough.
<string>I wasn't ready to fully take in the breadth of humanity.
<string>It's strange. All kinds of people across time and space seem<lf>to have built up cultures focusing on the enjoyment of tea.
<string>Maybe humans are predisposed to boiling things?<lf>Or perhaps tea exerts some sort of power over us.
<string>Silly thoughts like that pop into my head from time to time.
<string>I've gone through a lot during my life. At one point,<lf>it became difficult for me to interact with the world.
<string>But eventually, I was able to return to the<lf>professor's expedition team.
<string>I met Nata soon after that.
<string>The professor was kind enough to wait until<lf>I decided I was ready to step back into things.
<string>I'm incredibly grateful to him.
<string>I've learned to like a number of things<lf>over the course of this expedition.
<string>Like strong headwinds, for example.
<string>It's made me confident enough to be able<lf>to put my foot down and yell, "I'm alive!"
<string>I realized I can live anywhere. Once that hit me, it felt like<lf>I'd regained something I'd long since forgotten.
<string>Now my goal is to lead a life that's affirming<lf>of humanity in all its forms.
<string>Why did you take an interest in cultural<lf>anthropology in the first place?
<string>Me? Well... It's difficult to put into words, but...
<string>I guess you could say it was because it seemed so...vibrant.
<string>Clothing, food, dwellings, languages, expressions...<lf>There were so many colorful things I'd never seen before.
<string>I thought that was the most beautiful thing.
<string>By the way, have you gotten used to receiving<lf>hunting authorization in the field?
<string>Haha... Sorry, that was a silly question, wasn't it?
<string>Unlike the Guild at large, field surveys have limited personnel<lf>and require urgency, which is why this system is necessary.
<string>But that doesn't mean hunters are allowed<lf>to do what they please anywhere they go.
<string>The moment you forget that is the moment<lf>you stop being a true hunter.
<string>So please, always keep that in mind, no matter what.
<string>I think you're the only one who could have<lf>chosen not to stop the Dragontorch.
<string>Regardless of what anyone else says,<lf>I think you made the right choice.
<string>Even if others don't agree.
<string>Preparing to enter the Forbidden Lands was a real ordeal,<lf>because we needed to learn their language.
<string>We had to get the words from Nata to create<lf>a curriculum for everyone.
<string>But we didn't want to push him either,<lf>so the linguists and I struggled with what to do.
<string>We were really lucky that the language of the East shares<lf>similarities with the ancient language of the West.
<string>The other day, the Elder of Kunafa<lf>told me about their funeral customs.
<string>She said, "Just as our lives are one with the sand<lf>and lightning, so too is our passing."
<string>"We clad our dead in particular outfits, then<lf>carry them up a hill right before the Sandtide."
<string>"As the storm hits, they return to the sky amidst the wind<lf>and lightning. That is how we Sandfolk conclude our lives."
<string>Um... So... I have a request.
<string>If I lose my life out here, would you send me off<lf>in the way that's customary for them?
<string>You have to promise me. And don't you dare forget!
<string>Come to think of it, it seems like Gemma had<lf>a number of adventures when she was little.
<string>Apparently, she was acquainted with another hunter back then.
<string>When I asked her to tell me what they were like,<lf>she just shrugged me off with a laugh.
<string>I guess those memories are so precious to her<lf>that it's difficult for her to share them.
<string>This is neither here nor there,<lf>but that plushie Gemma has is so lovely.
<string>From what she's said, it seems like<lf>a dear friend made it for her.
<string>It's a little...uh, unique, but it does a fantastic job of<lf>capturing the monster's characteristics— Hold on.
<string>Come to think of it, I remember seeing doodles<lf>with a very similar style in Dundorma's archives...
<string>When we first found Nata, everyone was in a dither.
<string>Both the Guild and the Academy were desperate<lf>to get information out of him.
<string>So the professor and some others stood up to<lf>protect him and took him into their custody.
<string>After that, he slowly recovered.<lf>The first thing he said to me was...
<string>"What's that color called?"<lf>as he pointed to the sunset.
<string>Nata's a real trooper, you know?
<string>Um... I was talking with Olivia the other day,<lf>and the thought occurred to me...
<string>I wonder if she's her own role model?
<string>That's just the impression I get somehow.
<string>I'm sure Erik would say the same thing.<lf>He's good at observing people.
<string>You know, Erik's actually a little frightening.
<string>He's extremely observant when it comes to people,<lf>almost as if he's studying a creature or monster.
<string>To the extent that he may know things about you<lf>that you don't even know yourself.
<string>Perhaps that's just how he learned to interact with people,<lf>because he became a scholar at such a young age.
<string>By the way, are you familiar with a treatise written<lf>by someone named Rowan Liviere?
<string>It compares the hierarchies formed by organisms in extreme<lf>ecosystems with a natural trend towards equilibrium.
<string>I casually brought it up to Erik once,<lf>and he responded with, "That was me."
<string>Apparently, he used a pseudonym because he was too<lf>young at the time to feasibly publish something like that.
<string>I feel so bad for him. He must've walked<lf>a difficult path.
<string>Incidentally, he also dismissed the treatise<lf>as "the naive conclusions of a child."
<string>A long time ago, Professor Fabius said Erik is incredibly<lf>tenacious when it comes to "knowing" things.
<string>And that he shows an incredible tenacity<lf>for wanting things to "be known."
<string>He said it was both a strength—and a naivety...
<string>I actually wasn't previously aware of what kind of<lf>work Werner has done over the course of his life.
<string>When I looked into it, I nearly spat out my tea!<lf>He's accomplished some pretty incredible things.
<string>He's a significant historical figure, but you wouldn't<lf>know it at all from the way he acts.
<string>Honestly, it's terrifying, in a way.
<string>Haha... Rosso from the Rubrum Unit<lf>is such an enigmatic person.
<string>We were having a casual conversation recently, when<lf>suddenly he tells me that "Rosso" is only a nickname.
<string>He flashed a big smile and called it his "spirit name."
<string>Is he just undaunted by anything, or is he really so composed?<lf>I have a hard time finding the words to describe him.
<string>I've met Alessa from the Turris Unit once before.
<string>Her whole family came and caused a commotion<lf>when she tried to join the Guild.
<string>They urged the professor to take responsibility and help<lf>mediate any succession disputes if the worst came to pass.
<string>But Alessa turned to them all and shouted,<lf>"Fools! I'm not going to die! Disperse at once!"
<string>Coming to the Forbidden Lands must not have<lf>been easy for her.
<string>Despite her age, Mina from the Vespae Unit<lf>has experienced many harrowing missions.
<string>According to the professor, her temperament has<lf>slowly evened out compared to how she used to be.
<string>You're curious about what nicknames she had back then?<lf>There were a lot.
<string>Beast, Ogre, Lone Wolf, Scarlet, Killer Bee, Mad Dog...
<string>I remember the professor talking about Mina and Kai once.
<string>He said they caused him a lot of trouble.
<string>Mina has a tendency to cheerfully rush into things while<lf>considering herself to be of secondary importance.
<string>And Kai is capable of grasping the situation,<lf>but doesn't care about anyone, including himself.
<string>Though he's a lot better now than<lf>he used to be, from what I've heard.
<string>Oh, I was speaking to Desi,<lf>Terra Unit's engineer, and...
<string>He said not only does Kai not care about his eating habits,<lf>but he's also not interested in human relationships.
<string>According to Desi, Kai is always aware of what's happening,<lf>but doesn't show any concern for individual people.
<string>It took quite a long time for him to learn<lf>anything about Kai besides his name.
<string>Thinking about it, this mission has been<lf>particularly rough on Palicoes, hasn't it?
<string>They already have trouble with human language,<lf>and now they have to learn another one.
<string>Felyne mouths and tongues are built<lf>differently from ours, you know.
<string>So only the most skilled among them can undergo<lf>the special training required to speak our language!
<string>Bearing that in mind, don't you think<lf>your Palico deserves some praise?
<string>Oh, you've officially racked up more than <VARIOUS type="PLAYTIME"><lf>investigation reports, by the way.
<string>I bet that stack will only keep growing, too.
<string>You've now got <EMPARAM value="NUM" target="BOSS" act="HUNT" type="MAX"> handler reports<lf>on <EMPARAM value="NAME" target="BOSS" act="HUNT" type="MAX">.
<string>You've really come a long way.
<string>You want to know which monster you<lf>have the least reports on? Let's see here...
<string>That would be <EMPARAM value="NAME" target="BOSS" act="HUNT" type="MIN"> reports.<lf>You only have <EMPARAM value="NUM" target="BOSS" act="HUNT" type="MIN"> on that one.
<string>You've captured <EMPARAM value="NUM" target="BOSS" act="CAPTURE" type="MAX"> <EMPARAM value="NAME" target="BOSS" act="CAPTURE" type="MAX">.
<string>Capturing a monster requires quite a lot of skill, so the fact<lf>that you've accomplished such a feat is seriously impressive.
<string>According to Samin, the endemic life that you have the most<lf>reports on is <EMPARAM value="NAME" target="ANIMAL" act="CAPTURE" type="MAX">.
<string>He said they seem to have taken a liking to him,<lf>and seemed really pleased about it.
<string>According to Samin, the endemic life that needs to be<lf>researched the most right now is <EMPARAM value="NAME" target="ANIMAL" act="CAPTURE" type="MIN">.
<string>He wondered if perhaps they all hated him,<lf>and seemed pretty broken up about it.
<string>Did you see the chronicle Kanya put together?
<string>It says: "<PLNAME> has caught <EMPARAM value="NUM" target="FISH" act="CAPTURE" type="MAX"> <EMPARAM value="NAME" target="FISH" act="CAPTURE" type="MAX">."
<string>I hope she's still getting her handler work done, too...
<string>Umm, the heaviest fish you've caught so far is<lf><EMPARAM value="NAME" target="FISH" act="WEIGHT" type="MAX">...
<string>weighing in at <EMPARAM value="NUM" target="FISH" act="WEIGHT" type="MAX">!<lf>Was it hard to reel up?
<string>Umm, the largest fish you've caught so far is<lf><EMPARAM value="NAME" target="FISH" act="SIZE" type="MAX">...
<string>at <EMPARAM value="NUM" target="FISH" act="SIZE" type="MAX">!<lf>Is there anything in this world that can't be fished up?
<string>I was organizing my reports earlier and it made me realize...
<string>You've gone on <VARIOUS type="CLEARNUM"> surveys now.
<string>Keep up the good work.
<string>Oh yeah, Dareel wanted to thank you<lf>for capturing that <VARIOUS type="CAP_EM">.
<string>He says he loves listening to it breathe while it sleeps.
<string>By the way, Samin was really happy that<lf>you captured that <VARIOUS type="CAP_EM">.
<string>He said it was the first time he'd ever heard one snore.
<string>Ferdinand was extremely grateful to you<lf>for catching that <VARIOUS type="CAP_EM">.
<string>He said he feels blessed to be able to watch it sleep.
<string>Oh, Samin was telling me about the fangs from that<lf><VARIOUS type="CAP_EM"> you captured.
<string>Apparently, they look minuscule from far away,<lf>but are quite large when inspected from up close.
<string>I saw Dareel fawning over that<lf><VARIOUS type="CAP_EM"> you captured.
<string>He was sighing and muttering something like,<lf>"How can you be so utterly captivating?"
<string>I overheard Ferdinand say he thought that<lf><VARIOUS type="CAP_EM"> had the grandeur of a leviathan.
<string>He was smiling from ear to ear as he said it.
<string>Ferdinand was saying that he sensed a sort<lf>of melancholy in that <VARIOUS type="CAP_EM">.
<string>I guess all flying wyverns have that quality to them,<lf>hiding beneath their overwhelming magnificence.
<string>Or, that's what he said anyway,<lf>as he gazed off into the distance.

<string><COLOR FF0000>#Rejected#</COLOR> Dia_NPC102_00_001_Communication_078_t01
<string>I saw Samin fervently observing that<lf><VARIOUS type="CAP_EM">.
<string>He was saying something about how temnocerans are<lf>the perfect combination of simplicity and elegance.
<string>Ferdinand came by to tell me it was hard<lf>to measure that <VARIOUS type="CAP_EM">.
<string>He was rubbing his lower back as he said it...<lf>the poor man.

<string>Yes, I know. Meat is just so invigorating.<lf>Something one would be lucky to eat every day.
<string>Oh, no, that's not my own opinion. I'm simply voicing<lf>the thoughts in your heart.
<string>There's nothing like a perfectly cooked fish. They're so<lf>soft and juicy that they practically melt in your mouth.
<string>Let's have fish again tomorrow.<lf>You're so good at grilling them.
<string>Those grilled veggies had such a natural deliciousness<lf>to them. They made me feel relaxed somehow.
<string>I was thinking about why that was, and...
<string>It was probably the thought of getting a nutritionally<lf>balanced diet.
<string>Olivia stopped by earlier to say,<lf>"No injuries? Then good."
<string>Um... I just overheard Alessa muttering to herself about you.
<string>"If only I had the courage of that Avis Unit hunter,"
<string>"I might've been able to wade through that swamp<lf>of schemers with more wisdom and tenacity."
<string>Rosso came by and asked with a cheerful smile,<lf>"Was I helpful?"
<string>"I'll give you a hand any time. Cheerfully!"
<string>Mina just came by and said, "Your hunter was stunning<lf>in that fight! It really got my blood pumping!"
<string>She seemed positively ecstatic.<lf>I guess that's the Killer Bee for you.
<string>Professor Fabius came by a minute ago and said,<lf>"The Avis hunter fought brilliantly earlier."
<string>"So long as we have hunters like that..."<lf>He trailed off, looking emotional.
<string>Kai asked about you earlier, by the way.
<string>He said he's grown interested in hearing of the<lf>places you've hunted and how you survived them.
<string>Oh yeah, I was asking Kanya what it meant when you see<lf>splashes on the surface of the water, and she said:
<string>"Well you see, that happens when a group of smaller<lf>fish are being preyed upon by a large one."
<string>"That's the best time and place to drop your lure!<lf>You can get different fish depending on the lure, too."
<string>"Keep an eye out for wingdrakes overhead!<lf>That's how you can find these spots."
<string>From what I've heard, the Tentacle Jig<lf>originated in the land of Shiki.
<string>There, it's called an "egi" which means "lure tree."
<string>A book described it as the result of a meeting<lf>of minds between anglers and engineers.
<string>It also noted, "Jiggle it then let it sink.<lf>Wait before repeating."
<string>Oh, of course, I should mention that<lf>I borrowed that book from Kanya.
<string>There are ancient records that mention a monster<lf>with similar characteristics to that of Arkveld.
<string>Though they don't say anything about it<lf>being able to absorb and convert elements.
<string>I suppose that means that Guardians have enhanced abilities<lf>in comparison to the monsters they're derived from.
<string>I wonder why Arkveld was chosen to be one?<lf>What function did it serve?
<string>I just hope that it will be able to live a normal life<lf>here, after everything that's happened to it.
<string>Erik told me something interesting about<lf>the trees in the Scarlet Forest.
<string>If transplanted to soil from a different area,<lf>they cease to produce their characteristic red sap.
<string>Fascinating, right? I wonder exactly what<lf>substance it is that gives them their red hue.
<string>And—apparently—neither the red nor regular<lf>sap varieties are poisonous. Wait...
<string>How does Erik determine that something isn't poisonous?<lf>Actually, you know what? I don't want to think about it.
<string>Incidentally, Azuz's festival dates back to times long past.
<string>I'm curious about what sorts of things they made<lf>back then, and how they went about it.
<string>From what the Keepers have said, it seems a lot<lf>of Azuz's products were brought to Wyveria.
<string>Um... I noticed something when the Iceshard Cliffs<lf>experience a season of Plenty.
<string>The cliffs on Wyveria's side seem to be decorated<lf>from top to bottom with rare monster parts.
<string>Their unique appearance is what first caught my eye,<lf>and then I realized how many there were!
<string>Of course I know that many lives are lost<lf>in the process of keeping another one alive.
<string>I'm sure the people of the past had their own morality system<lf>built with that in mind. Or I certainly hope they did.
<string>I felt something watching me recently, and when I looked up,<lf>I was staring straight into a pair of Gillopod eyes.
<string>I'm embarrassed to admit that it startled me so much,<lf>I squealed.
<string>Those blazing pupils... The way its body pulses<lf>with Wylk energy...
<string>Wyveria is full of things like that: creatures that feed<lf>on Wylk, and white plants that grow in the dark.
<string>Part of me is fascinated by it all.
<string>But the other part of me can't help but shudder when<lf>I think about how it's all connected to Wyvern Milk.
<string>You know how Nata likes cheese, right?
<string>Well, Kunafa's cheese is made from Dalthydon milk.
<string>Dalthydon are very important to the people of Kunafa.<lf>They aid in manual labor, and provide milk and fur.
<string>In fact, that's one of the reasons Kunafa's people hardly<lf>ever eat meat: because Dalthydon are so precious to them.
<string>Gelidron meat is a staple in Azuz.
<string>It's got such a subtle flavor,<lf>and a delightfully sticky texture.
<string>And the way they steam it to perfection is just...wow.
<string>It's no wonder it's so deeply rooted<lf>in all of Azuz's recipes.
<string>What most surprised me about the food here in<lf>the Forbidden Lands was when I saw Sild's crops.
<string>I still find it hard to believe they found a way to grow<lf>things in the dark while preserving their nutritional value.
<string>I've been deeply impressed by both the powers of Wyvern<lf>Milk and the Keepers themselves for learning to harness it.
<string>Also, when I saw that white color,<lf>something finally fell into place for me.
<string>It explains why Nata was hesitant to eat<lf>western food after we first rescued him.
<string>I didn't understand anything back then.
<string>When I first tried Suja's Downy Crake eggs, I was shocked.
<string>Downy Crakes are so wary, I never thought<lf>they'd be willing to share their eggs!
<string>I can only marvel at the people of Suja for<lf>being able to form a symbiotic bond like that.
<string>Apparently, the meat we had in Suja came from a Rafma.
<string>From what I was told, the Allhearken hears when one<lf>passes away, then gratefully shares it with everyone.
<string>It's so different from how we actively hunt things,<lf>and very fitting for the people of Suja.
<string>Downy Crakes are a pretty rare sight, even around here.
<string>Erik told me he only occasionally<lf>sees wild ones outside of Suja.
<string>Apparently, one time when he was with Olivia, both<lf>of them immediately shouted when they spotted one.
<string>Oh yeah, did you notice that the sandship we used<lf>on this mission doesn't have many weapons on it?
<string>That was partially due to the ship's maximum capacity,<lf>but it was mainly so that we didn't appear hostile.
<string>Of course, we never imagined that the East would<lf>have no concept of weapons whatsoever.
<string>Something's been on my mind lately. It's difficult to put into<lf>words, but...it's like I wish time would just grind to a halt.
<string>I wonder what everyone's doing right now?
<string>No matter how busy you are,<lf>you need to take a rest occasionally.
<string>Hehe... Do you want me to try to tell<lf>your fortune based on the weather?
