<string>Hey, hear me out a minute. We're in a real tight<lf>spot here.
<string>Is something wrong?
<string>Yeah. So, the good news is that we've been getting<lf>more Oricalcite lately, it's better quality, too.
<string>But more crafting means more scrap, and with this<lf>much being made, we've had to, y'know...dump it.
<string>And that's a problem?
<string>Stuff's been revered since ancient times. We don't<lf>mean any disrespect, just... We're all so busy, yeah?
<string>I don't know if it's related, but now we have this<lf>walking boulder turning up outside town.
<string>There are reports that people are getting hurt, too,<lf>but it's not something any of us can handle...
<string>It's possible it's related. Some species of<lf>monster feed on ores and metals.
<string>The Guild will look into the matter. Please just<lf>give us some time.
<string>There's things that eat metal!? Yeesh, all right...<lf>We'll leave it to you. Just be careful.
<string>Based on Dogard's account, it's likely a Gravios.
<string>It wouldn't be strange to think that the excess<lf>Oricalcite could have drawn it in.
<string>And it seems there have previously been sightings<lf>around Azuz.
<string>You are authorized to hunt that Gravios, before<lf>the damage spreads.
<string>I heard the news! Thanks for chasing off that sack of rocks for us.
<string>The monster fixated on the village has been<lf>dealt with, but please take care when storing ore.
<string>We will. Guess some traditions are there for good<lf>reason. We'll keep it in mind, you have my word.
<string>Besides, we're all eager to learn more about those<lf>things. As fellow rock-lovers, we gotta get along!
<string>Sorry for the trouble, though. We appreciate it.<lf>Here's something as thanks. Take it.
