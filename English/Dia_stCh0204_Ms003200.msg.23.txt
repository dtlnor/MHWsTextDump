<string>Let's prepare to leave quickly.
<string>We should all depart together.
<string>I need to find Alma.
<string>We should head for Kunafa as soon as possible.<lf>Are you all set on supplies?
<string>Right. Let's hurry.
<string>(Open the Quest Board)
<string>I need a little more time.
<string>Everyone, we're leaving.
<string>I hope everyone's all right.<lf>If the White Wraith is there...
<string>Travelers, thank you! Thank you for saving Maki.<lf>I don't know how to repay you.
<string>As a hunter, it is my duty and an honor.<lf>We're just glad she's safe.
<string>To think that one could stand against a monster<lf>like that. I never imagined...
<string>Your apprentice has a strong will and passion<lf>to spare. Why hold her back?
<string>It's...
<string>There was a time when I myself was ready to lay<lf>down life and limb for the sake of the festival.
<string>Then soon after I took her under my wing and right<lf>before the Firespring, she did something reckless...
<string>I realized nothing would quell that girl's spirit.<lf>She's too much like me.
<string>And when I realized this, I became very afraid.
<string>As you age, you fear some things less...<lf>but others more. Age changes your priorities.
<string>I don't have the courage to tell her that...<lf>Or to let that fire inside her burn freely.
<string>I suppose that's your answer. I'm just<lf>a cowardly old man...
<string>Olivia was saying that it could<lf>be out in the desert.
<string>That's giving me a bad feeling...
<string>If I were a hunter like you, I could say where it<lf>is more precisely...
<string>Is it expanding its territory? Or—no, wait...
<string>The desert will always be a dangerous place during<lf>the Inclemency. Be sure to head out well prepared.
<string>Landspine, Landspine, Landspine...
<string>Thing's got a fancy little name, but it's serious<lf>business, I'll tell you that.
<string>You can tell a lot even from one glance at those<lf>crystals, yeah?
<string>They've got a Sandtide, we've got a Firespring.<lf>Just what the heck is happening here?
<string>We're gonna hear what Werner has to say. It sounds<lf>like he figured something out about the Firespring.
<string>You be good an' careful too, friend.
<string>I still can't believe the Firespring won't come.<lf>This cycle's been set in stone forever. Hasn't it?
<string>So, sounds like Werner is going to look into the<lf>Firespring for us.
<string>We really appreciate it. I'll go and see if<lf>there's any way we can help him.
<string>He's here with you, right? Werner? He sure seems<lf>knowledgeable.
