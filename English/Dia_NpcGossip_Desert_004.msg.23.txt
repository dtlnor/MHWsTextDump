<string>I've got some freshly aged cheese here.<lf>Wanna split it?
<string>Well, twist my arm. Thanks!
<string>I bet it would feel amazing to go zip around<lf>on a Seikret for a while.
<string>Going out during the Fallow just sounds like<lf>you're courting danger to me.
<string>Sometimes I wish I could just zone out for a while.
<string>It'd be great to just enjoy the beauty of the<lf>Plenty for once.
<string>It's the perfect time to go out on that Seikret ride.
<string>Let's go out and bring something back<lf>for the village.
<string>I mean, I hear what the Elder is saying.<lf>I do! But think about my perspective...
<string>I get it, believe me. But I can also understand<lf>the Elder's point.
<string>I made some cheese. Want a piece?
<string>I'd love one. We can see whose tastes better.
<string>I wish I could get my Seikret more water to drink.
<string>We can ask the water bearers about it next time.
<string>All done with your cleaning? Why don't we take<lf>a little break, then?
<string>Alright, why not?
<string>In terms of fears, Doshaguma are right<lf>at the top of my list.
<string>Thought I'd died on the spot that day they all came<lf>rushing in.
<string>Then just below them are the sand leviathans...
<string>Fresh-made cheese is the tastiest thing in Kunafa.
<string>No way. The aged cheese we trade is the best.<lf>The people in Azuz are crazy for it.
