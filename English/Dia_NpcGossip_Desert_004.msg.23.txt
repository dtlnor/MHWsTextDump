<string>I've got some freshly aged cheese here.<lf>Wanna split it?
<string>Well, twist my arm. Thanks!
<string>I bet it would feel amazing to go zip around<lf>on a Seikret for a while.
<string>Going out during the Fallow just sounds like<lf>you're courting danger to me.
<string>Sometimes I wish I could just zone out for a while.
<string>It'd be great to just enjoy the beauty of the<lf>Plenty for once.
<string>It's the perfect time to go out on that Seikret ride.
<string>Let's go out and bring something back<lf>for the village.
<string>I mean, I hear what the Elder is saying.<lf>I do! But think about my perspective...
<string>I get it, believe me. But I can also understand<lf>the Elder's point.
