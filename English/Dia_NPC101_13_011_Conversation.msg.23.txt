<string>The others are laboring to gather enough<lf>quality oil.
<string>Though I have cautioned them not to<lf>overexert themselves...
<string>If the tribes reach deep and make the most of<lf>their potential, the festival will surely go well.
<string>The tricky part is getting all the pieces in a row<lf>so we can do that.
<string>Everyone is fired up and ready to make the next<lf>festival our most abundant yet.
<string>Whatever trade you can conduct with us in kind<lf>is appreciated, Hunter.
<string>The Oilfolk are eager to make something big of<lf>the upcoming festival.
<string>I think the wild enthusiasm of the last one is<lf>still humming in their bones.
<string>After <NUMBER {0}> successful festivals in a row,<lf>it's only natural to expect the same again.
<string>And I will admit, this is a fire that I hope they<lf>keep burning for generations to come.
<string>It's been a while since we last looked forward<lf>to the Firespring like this.
<string>Doesn't light when you want it to, and doesn't<lf>stop when you try to put it out.
<string>Fires are much like people in that way.
<string>Fire is life. At least, to this old man it is.
<string>Thanks to everyone's tireless work, the festivals<lf>have been one success after another.
<string>I should've known better than to try and contain<lf>the fire in <ITALIC>our</ITALIC> young people.
<string>There aren't words, travelers.<lf>I cannot thank you enough.
<string>After that whole ordeal, and no Firespring?<lf>What a cruel twist.
<string>So the time for us to test our mettle has come...
<string>That must have been the finest Oricalcite I've ever<lf>laid eyes on.
<string>And yet, it wasn't the Oricalcite that<lf>shone brightest.
<string>There they go getting carried away again...<lf>Too much fire in their kilns!
<string>Not that I completely disapprove...<lf>Heh heh heh.
<string>Something feels amiss.
<string>The Firespring... It's out of control...
<string>We found a way to keep the Everforge going...but<lf>it won't hold forever.
<string>If you learn anything new—even the tiniest detail—<lf>please tell us.
<string>Of course.
<string>Again, you have come to our rescue.<lf>You hunters are a force to be reckoned with.
<string>To you, we must seem foolish for getting worked up<lf>over one little flame.
<string>But we find joy in our way of life.
<string>Every so often, a bird of peerless plumage will<lf>fly through, leaving as magnificently as it came.
<string>Whatever else may come, our young people deserve<lf>to grow up healthy and strong.
<string>That is my one desire.
<string>Maki is doing fine. And Roqul, of course...<lf>All of the villagers, in fact.
<string>Even I've been getting along as well as can<lf>be expected. These are fair days.
<string>I look at you and see the wings of a great bird<lf>sent to watch over us.
