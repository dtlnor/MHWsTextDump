<string>Today's training creates tomorrow's me!
<string>Constant training won't always show<lf>visible results.
<string>But you know what they say! No pain, no gain!<lf>The more you put in, the more you'll get out.
<string>Training can be a bit lonely...
<string>Yo, Hunter! Are you making good use of the<lf>High Purrformance Barrel Puncher?
<string>I do daily maintenance so it's always ready<lf>to go. Feel free to really lay into it!
<string>So, uh. Have you noticed the guy up on the High<lf>Purrformance Barrel Puncher?
<string>Seems he's got an eye for big rides like that.<lf>Always looks like he's having a blast controlling it.
