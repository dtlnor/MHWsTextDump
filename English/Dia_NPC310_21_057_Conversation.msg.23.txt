<string>Today's training creates tomorrow's me!
<string>Constant training won't always show<lf>visible results.
<string>But you know what they say! No pain, no gain!<lf>The more you put in, the more you'll get out.
<string>Training can be a bit lonely...
<string>Yo, Hunter! Are you making good use of the<lf>High Purrformance Barrel Puncher?
<string>I do daily maintenance so it's always ready<lf>to go. Feel free to really lay into it!
<string>I'm in charge of keeping this Training Area<lf>in ready-to-use condition.
<string>There's no better place to practice swinging<lf>those weapons of yours around!
<string>You can use all the settings here to make<lf>your own custom workout plan.
<string>Workouts are all about hands-on learning, though.<lf>So go on, give it a try!
<string>So the Support Team made it in safe and sound?<lf>That's a relief!
<string>We've got our different strengths, but we're all<lf>here to help you out! You can rely on them!
<string>I heard a <ITALIC>super</ITALIC> scary monster trashed the camp.
<string>Shame about the camp, but I'm glad no one's hurt.
<string>Hunter! I heard you took down that alpha!<lf>That's so awesome.
<string>You do all that, but still come in to train?<lf>Talk about no days off!
<string>Yo, Hunter! I heard you're chasing a monster<lf>right into the heart of a sandstorm! Is that true?
<string>When you're face to face with an unknown monster,<lf>your training is the only thing you can rely on.
<string>Wow, you really pulled through for us, Hunter.
<string>That's what no days off gets you! Results!
<string>Did you see? Fabius's body was like a slab<lf>of tempered steel...
<string>How much does a guy have to train<lf>to look like that, you think?
<string>I heard you're touring each region<lf>for your investigation.
<string>I'm jealous. It's hard to get in a good long-<lf>distance run here.
<string>I'll be the first to preach about no days off, but<lf>resting is a key part in building muscle, too.
<string>A rest day is just as important as leg day! It's<lf>all about balance and maintaining your body.
<string>I could watch the way you move for hours, Hunter.<lf>I feel a sense of satisfaction just looking at you.
<string>It's hard to stay motivated when the weather<lf>keeps changing all the time like this.

<string>So, uh. Have you noticed the guy up on the High<lf>Purrformance Barrel Puncher?
<string>Seems he's got an eye for big rides like that.<lf>Always looks like he's having a blast controlling it.
