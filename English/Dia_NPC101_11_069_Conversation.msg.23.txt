<string>The Vanguard exists to sense danger before it<lf>comes. To watch with eyes, ears, nose, and skin.
<string>My role is to trust what their senses tell them,<lf>and to respond to the threats they warn us of.
<string>We must ready ourselves for the Sandtide...
<string>I had never thought to fight a monster. To me<lf>it is akin to challenging the wind or rain.
<string>To imagine anyone could be so bold to even try...<lf>I'm truly speechless.
<string>I must thank you again for the aid<lf>you gave Y'sai and Nona.
<string>It is much too soon for them to face mortal peril.
<string>I turned you away when first you came to<lf>the village.
<string>In hindsight, it was a stark lapse of courtesy.<lf>...I am ashamed of my words then.
<string>We store up water during the season of Plenty.<lf>It helps put the village at ease.
<string>It is truly a blessing to hear the children laugh<lf>carefree as they run about the village.
<string>I pray that such peaceful days may continue.
<string>Bustling streets, verdant land, ripe harvests...<lf>This is truly a time of abundance.
<string>But the season bestows its blessings on monsters<lf>as well. It is a busy time for the Vanguard.
<string>How fare your Seikret? Judging from the scent<lf>surrounding you...
<string>It appears you have been spending ample time<lf>together. Please, continue to treat them with care.
<string>As the sand flows like time, so do the people.<lf>I had thought our way of life was firmly fixed.
<string>I know now that nothing is impervious to change.<lf>A lesson to impart to my successor.
<string>I will tell them of your tales as well.
<string>The Elder is a great teller of stories. One in<lf>particular is much beloved by the children here.
<string>It is the tale of a great bird that healed the stark<lf>rift between the land and its people.
<string>What was the bird called, again...? I recall its<lf>name holding the meaning "the binding force."
<string>I am truly grateful for your aid. If there is anything<lf>I can do to assist you, simply speak the words.
<string>I am in utter shock.
<string>You threaded a pack of sand leviathans to save me,<lf>easily banished the threat bound for the village...
<string>Just who <ITALIC>are</ITALIC> you?
<string>The eye of the storm sits at the Wind's Gasp.<lf>A truly frightening being may await there.
<string>But you all clearly have your reasons for going.<lf>May the winds guide you on your journey.
<string>It is thanks to you that the village was spared<lf>Rey Dau's wrath. I am grateful.
<string>That is a creature that stirs fear in all who<lf>dwell among the sands.
<string>But mimicking the sound of the gemchime stones<lf>it wears keeps our village safe.
<string>Just as our old saying goes, "Fear and draw not<lf>near. We will be protected."
<string><PLNAME>. The wind here bears a subtly<lf>different scent.
<string>I lack the words to describe it, but...<lf>I advise caution.
<string>Is everything going well here?
<string>It is. The rebuilding effort is progressing<lf>smoothly.
<string>The people's smiles have brightened as we enter<lf>the time of Plenty. I invite you all to rest.
<string>Since entering the Fallow, the winds feel...<lf>different. I hope it is my imagination.
<string>If you had not come to our aid, I cannot imagine<lf>how long we would have been without homes.
<string>Yet here we are, living as though there were<lf>no disturbances. I am grateful.
<string>The variety of life in the Plains keeps growing.
<string>A wonderful thing, truly, but one in my position<lf>cannot rejoice so simply.
<string>We must watch for new dangers and protect our<lf>own until the newcomers settle into the order.
<string>Thank you for all your help.
<string>I am the one who should extend his thanks.<lf>It is by your hand that we are alive at all.

<string>Hm? Nemmo wants to help me? He actually said that?
<string>Ahem, well... That's...good. Good on him, yes.
<string>Truly, those children are the light on<lf>our path forward.
