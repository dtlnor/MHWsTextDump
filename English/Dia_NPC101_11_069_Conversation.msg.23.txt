<string>The Vanguard exists to sense danger before it<lf>comes. To watch with eyes, ears, nose, and skin.
<string>My role is to trust what their senses tell them,<lf>and to respond to the threats they warn us of.
<string>We must ready ourselves for the Sandtide...
<string>We store up water during the Season of Plenty.<lf>It helps put the village at ease.
<string>It is truly a blessing to hear the children laugh<lf>carefree as they run about the village.
<string>I pray that such peaceful days may continue.
<string>Bustling streets, verdant land, ripe harvests...<lf>This is truly a time of abundance.
<string>But the season bestows its blessings on monsters<lf>as well. It is a busy time for the Vanguard.
<string>Our elder is a great teller of stories. One in<lf>particular is much beloved by the children here.
<string>It is the tale of a great bird that healed the stark<lf>rift between the land and its people.
<string>What was the bird called, again...? I recall its<lf>name holding the meaning "the binding force."
