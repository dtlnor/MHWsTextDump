<string>Is it true, Hunter? That you assisted the<lf>ecological survey again?
<string>Is this about the endemic life I caught for Dareel?
<string>Yes! To think he would enlist a hunter's<lf>help not once, but twice?
<string>At this point, fairness dictates<lf>that it's my turn.
<string>Make for the Iceshard Cliffs and capture<lf>an endemic life sample for me there, please.
<string>And before you inquire, yes, this is an official<lf>Guild request. Not some personal vendetta.
<string>I was able to confirm the capture of that specimen<lf>from the Iceshard Cliffs. You really saved me!
<string>You sound pleased. Won this round, eh?
<string>Indeed, after drafting my report at breakneck<lf>speed. You should have seen his face.
<string>...Er, that is—
<string>I'm glad I could help.
<string>...You certainly did. I hope that I can ask for your<lf>assistance again in the future.
<string>Rime Beetles reside in cold climates and<lf>can be seen rolling up balls of packed snow.
<string>But to what end? I can't imagine snow offers much<lf>nutritional value. A matter for further study.
