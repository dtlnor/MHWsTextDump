<string>Here we go—hold on!
<string>We gotta save that girl!
<string>Wow, this thing's fast!
<string>We'll catch up in no time!
<string>Don't think we can make it through there.
<string>I think our ride knows a better way.
<string>Looks like it knows a way.
<string>But we can go over!
<string>It can glide!?
<string>No!
<string>She's in trouble!
<string>I know what to do.
<string>Y'sai...!
<string>Hey, that monster needs dealing with first!
<string>We need to save that girl!
<string>We have to take care of that monster first!
<string>Let's get outta here!
<string>I'll cover you!
<string>These things don't quit!
<string>On your flank!
<string>Look at all of them! On the rocks too!
<string>I bet we could bring those rocks down!
<string>I think we're home free!
<string>Hey, this way!
<string>Look, the others!
<string>We've got company!
<string>Mount up when you're ready to go.
<string>So they're called Seikret...
<string>We should focus first on saving that girl's brother.
<string>Are you ready to go?
<string>We should focus first on saving that girl's brother.
<string>Oh, that's right, have you decided on a weapon?
<string>Not yet. What do you recommend?
<string>Yes, I've already made up my mind.
<string>If you answer a few questions for me, I can get a better sense of<lf>your tastes and priorities and think of the perfect weapon for you.
<string>Wonderful. In that case, equip yourself and we'll be on our way.
<string>I need to feel the oomph from landing a powerful blow.
<string>Move quick and keep the enemy guessing!
<string>The best offense is a good defense.
<string>I prefer to take aim at my target from a distance.
<string>How would you describe your fighting style?
<string>And what do you look for in a weapon?
<string>What kind of tactics do you prefer to use?
<string>Overwhelming attack power.
<string>Diverse charge attack options.
<string>The flexibility to change form to match the needs of the situation.
<string>The ability to support my fellow hunters.
<string>The ability to launch a relentless onslaught of attacks.
<string>Quick, fluid attacks and improved vertical mobility.
<string>Parrying and counterattacking.
<string>The ability to guard and all-round reliability.
<string>Different forms of attack that offer situational adaptability.
<string>A range of defensive capabilities.
<string>Good defense, but I want to pack a punch too.
<string>I like to switch between ammo with a variety of types and effects.
<string>I prefer to wait for an opening and then attack with all I've got.
<string>I like to weave around enemy attacks while keeping the pressure on.
<string>If offense is your first priority,<lf>then this weapon might be a good match.
<string>If mobility is your first priority, then this weapon<lf>might be a good match.
<string>If defense is your first priority,<lf>then this weapon might be a good match.
<string>If you like to attack from a distance,<lf>this weapon could be a good match.
<string>Looks good.
<string>Any other recommendations?
<string>I'll pick a weapon out myself.
<string>Sure, let's take it from the top then.
<string>Understood. Feel free to select from any of these weapons.
<string>Have you chosen your weapon?
<string>I'd like to hear your recommendations again.
<string>I'll pick a weapon out myself.
<string>I'm good with what I have.
<string>You can try out your weapon over here.
<string>Once you've got a feel for the weapon, we'll head out.
<string>Alright. Let's have the Seikret follow the scent.
<string>I hope that girl's brother is OK...
<string>We should hurry.
<string>Wow! These Seikret are quite intelligent!<lf>Give them a scent and they'll follow it on their own.
<string>They're fast, too.
<string>I should focus on the mission first.
<string>We should probably go rescue that girl's brother first.
<string>Did you hear that?
<string>It's coming from in there.
<string>Caution, Hunter! Your target is a Chatacabra, an amphibian type!
<string>The Guild authorizes you to immediately neutralize<lf>this threat!
<string>I should focus on the rescue first.
<string>We need to do something about this Chatacabra first!
<string>Your attacks are working!
<string>Keep it up!
<string>Alright!
<string>Hey, monster—over here! I'm the one you want!
<string>It's targeting you. Be careful!
<string>Now's our chance!
<string>You did it!
<string>I'll get another chance later.
<string>That wound looks vulnerable!
<string>Aim for the wound while I get its attention!
<string>Yes!
<string>I'll find another opening.
<string>It's winding up a big attack!
<string>Perfect!
<string>(tsk) Missed my chance.
<string>Hop on the Seikret to get some distance!
<string>Your health is low! Jump on the Seikret and get clear of there!
<string>I should heal up.
<string>Weapon needs a bit of sharpening.
<string>We should be safe when we're on the Seikret!
<string>It's going to attack!
<string>We can head back to camp if you need to change<lf>your weapon.
<string>It's on the run. After it!
<string>You can use an SOS Flare to call for support!
<string>I should be able to use that.
<string>Don't mind if I do.
<string>Look, we've weakened it!
<string>Sorry for the wait. Did you find the girl's brother?
<string>Yes, he's safe.
<string>Are you OK? Where does it hurt?
<string>Let's get prepped, take the quest, and head back out there!
<string>Great work! I knew you were the best!
<string>We're over here.
<string>Wait, Hunter—we're over here!
<string>We're over here, Hunter. Is it safe to come out?
<string>I'm Y'sai. My sister and I are from a nearby village.
<string>My name is Nona!
<string>It's wonderful to meet you. I'm Alma. The others and I<lf>are here on a...search. We're from a place far out west.
<string>What happened back there?
<string>Where's your village?
<string>Can you tell us more about Seikret?
<string>(End Conversation)
<string>How did you end up in that situation back there?
<string>Oh... It was all my fault. I was careless. I was helping Nona<lf>with riding practice, and a Giant Toad snuck up on us.
<string>I told Nona to run for it while I got its attention, but when my<lf>Seikret and I tried to get away, he slipped and we fell into that cave.
<string>And so, uh...who exactly...are the two of you?
<string>Oh, right. We must have really surprised you earlier.
<string>Forgive me for my lack of understanding, but you use<lf>those...tools? I-I've never seen anything like that before.
<string>Back where we're from, specialists use these tools<lf>to protect others from large creatures.
<string>With the understanding that they're never to be<lf>brandished at other people, of course.
<string>Only those with special permission are allowed to use them.
<string>Tools... Specialists... Permission...<lf>It's all new to me, but I'm just glad you were there.
<string>Where's this village you say you're from?
<string>It's just a short distance away by Seikret.<lf>Nona and I live there with our grandmother.
<string>Would you happen to know of a tribe called the Keepers?
<string>The Keepers...? No, I don't. Sorry.
<string>I see... Well, that's OK. We're actually<lf>helping our friend here find his home.
<string>His people, they're called "the Keepers."
<string>The Keepers, huh... Hmmm... Sorry, I don't<lf>remember ever hearing that name before.
<string>But our Elder...she might know something.
<string>Thanks for letting us borrow your Seikret earlier.<lf>They were a tremendous help.
<string>Did you train them in your village?
<string>Yes! We raised them from eggs and trained them<lf>ourselves! They're invaluable to us as companions.
<string>They're so intelligent.<lf>They really came through for us back there.
<string>I know, right? They're great at sensing and avoiding trouble—<lf>and at remembering scents!
<string>But they're pretty tricky to handle,<lf>so not everyone's cut out for riding them.
<string>Take this guy, for example. He won't let just anyone<lf>ride him—he's almost too smart for his own good!
<string>So when I saw him take to you so easily,<lf>I was really impressed. You must have a gift.
<string>It won't do to keep you talking.<lf>Let's take a look at those wounds.
<string>Why don't we have a look around Base Camp?
