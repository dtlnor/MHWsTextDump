<string>Hunter. We've received a special assignment from<lf>the Guild!
<string>We're to hunt Arkveld, a monster of legend.<lf>What we know of it is very limited.
<string>A quest is now available for this assignment. Speak with me<lf>or see the quest board in the tent to accept it.
<string>As they say, prepare for the worst. ...And be careful!
<string>This overwhelming presence... It has to be Arkveld!
<string>The Guild has almost no information regarding<lf>this monster. We must approach this hunt carefully.
<string>Good work, Hunter. I'm so happy you're all right.
<string>Your ability to face such a threat, head on...<lf>Your skills really are something to admire.
<string>It's a relief to know that you'll have our<lf>backs no matter what we encounter.
