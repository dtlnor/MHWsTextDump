<string>It stokes a fiery passion in my chest.
<string>Let each of us perform our duties true.
<string>At times, I ask that you share your wisdom with me.<lf>Of course, I'll offer mine in return.

<string>Perhaps you all have chosen a different path...
<string>Whatever comes, whatever choices we make—<lf>all are a part of the workings of life.
<string>Nothing more to it. Such is my belief.
<string>The path you've chosen, too, is a part of the<lf>workings of life. Nothing more.
<string>What is there to be surprised by?
<string>Come, today is but another day—as was yesterday.<lf>Let each of us perform our duties true.
<string>Tomorrow waits atop the pile of all of today's<lf>small moments.
<string>Wounded Hollow is a desolate place. I'm amazed<lf>that you would work to bring it peace.
<string>Your thinking never ceases to amaze me, Hunter.
<string>Whatever comes, today is but another day.<lf>We can only endeavor to perform our duties true.

<string>Tomorrow waits atop the pile of all of today's<lf>small moments.
<string>Today is another fine day, Hunter.
<string>Should the day come that you leave this land,<lf>I will accept your decision.
<string>But wheresoever you go, do not forget:<lf>Tomorrow always waits atop the pile of today's moments.
