<string>Now's not the time for detours.
<string>Come on, follow me!
<string>Hey, stay with me!
<string>OK then. Away we go!
<string>Lead on.
<string>This is gonna be fun. Here, hop on.
<string>OK!
<string>Whoa! These are harder to handle than they look.
<string>They're so fast!
<string>How many Seikret do your people have?
<string>Lots of 'em—adults, and hatchlings too.
<string>Really?
<string>But training them is a lot of work. And only those<lf>who put in the practice can join the Vanguard.
<string>So then, Zatoh...
<string>Yes. He leads the Vanguard.
<string>And we're gatecrashing while he's away.<lf>What's NOT to like about this plan?
<string>So, how did you know where to find us before?
<string>I was on my way to your camp to give you<lf>the Seikret when they picked up your scent.
<string>I didn't even have to find you! They did.
<string>They really are clever.
<string>How's Nona?
<string>She's good. I know she's eager to see you again.<lf>She didn't even get to say good-bye last time.
<string>I miss her, too!
<string>Greetings, brother. May we enter?
<string>Greetings. I'll tell the Elder you're here.
<string>This way, friends.
<string>I don't think the others would appreciate it if I left.
<string>Sorry, do you mind waiting just a bit longer?<lf>We're almost ready.
<string>Come on, Alma! Let's go!
<string>Alright, but remember what I said about being respectful.
<string>I know!
<string>Whoa! Check out this stonework!
<string>The people here seem...busy.
<string>Yeah, it's like they're preparing for something.
<string>Look, Alma! Seikret eggs!
<string>This must be a hatchery.
<string>Be still. We don't want to frighten them.
<string>OK.
<string>That gentleman doesn't seem to be busy.<lf>Why don't we try him?
<string>Who is this cutie?
<string>It's so fuzzy!
<string>Fuzzy-wuzzy!
<string>You wanna play?
<string>I'm what's called a Felyne. Pleased to meet you.
<string>Flea mine?
<string>That's <ITALIC>Felyne!</ITALIC>
<string>Nice to meet you!
<string>Yeaaah, my whiskers come in pretty thick.
<string>Whoaaa! It's true!
<string>It's a mustache!
<string>They've got a mustache!

<string>Where are you from?
<string>A faraway land!
<string>Far...away?
<string>You mean the forest?
<string>It's fuzzier than a Doshaguma!
<string>Fuzzy-wuzzy!
<string>I saw the Doshaguma hunting close to the village.
<string>Again? It's getting more frequent.
<string>It's OK. We don't need to worry.
<string>I just don't understand why Doshaguma would be <ITALIC>here.</ITALIC>
<string>They could've come from the forest?<lf>Maybe they'll go back soon!
<string>Here's hoping.
<string>The gemchimes will protect the village, same as<lf>they always have.
<string>You say that, but Doshaguma are savage creatures.
<string>Sure, because it's the Fallow.
<string>Well, anyway, I need to get tidying...
<string>Say, have a look at this fabric.
<string>Oh, yes! That's fine weaving. And so colorful, too.
<string>Yes! I tried a new technique that<lf>preserves the pigmentation better.
<string>Such talent! I would love to see what you<lf>can do with other colors.
<string>At this point, I'm tempted to take this<lf>tapestry around. Show it off to everyone.
<string>Yeah? You should!
<string>Nothing feels better than when<lf>you weave a real winner.
<string>You're certainly in a good mood today.<lf>I'm glad, it's nice to see.
<string>If they all turned out like this,<lf>you'd see it more.
<string>Oh ho ho! It's always the Sandtide<lf>in your heart, dear.
<string>We're sorry to bother you, but...we were<lf>wondering if we could ask you something.
<string>Oh, it's no bother.
<string>Have you ever heard of the Keepers?
<string>No, I'm afraid not.
<string>But the Elder might know. She lives<lf>in the house up the path.
<string>Thank you.
<string>Sorry that I don't know anything about<lf>these Keepers.
<string>The Elder may know something we don't. Her home<lf>is just up the hill.
<string>I know you're all in a hurry to get searching,<lf>but it's best not to go out right now.
<string>The storm will be here soon.
<string>Mhm. Any day now.<lf>We need to stockpile more water.
<string>I agree, we've not nearly enough.
<string>We should send out more<lf>water-bearers while there's still time.
<string>So, just between us... Drawing water and shearing<lf>are both a pain.
<string>A big pain. A really painful pain. Just <ITALIC>agony.</ITALIC>
<string>Drawing water and shearing are important, no<lf>question. Also? A huge pain.
<string>I hear you. I wish I were in bed.
<string>Just keeping it completely real here...? The<lf>Sandtide's a pain.
<string>Oh, pure mental anguish. Sand gets all up in the<lf>folds of your clothes, your hair dries out...
<string>Still, every Fallow's end brings the Sandtide.
<string>And every time it's awful.
<string>Hey, look. What's that stranger carrying?
<string>Hmmm...looks dangerous.
<string>Why would you wanna lug<lf>around something like that?
<string>That thing looks kind of dangerous...
<string>What do you suppose it is? Other than enormous, I mean.
<string>Do you suppose they're travelers? Wonder how far<lf>off they're from.
<string>Where could they be from? Maybe that thing they're<lf>carrying is a local handicraft?
<string>Could be. It's a bigger tool than you see around<lf>these parts.
<string>We probably shouldn't stare. Manners, and all.
<string>You're right. I hope we weren't too rude about it.
<string>Come in, come in! Don't be shy.
<string>The children have told me much about you.<lf>Sit, for we have matters to discuss.
<string>What's wrong? Be at ease.
<string>You can make yourself comfortable right there.
<string>Hello. Can we speak to the Elder of this village?
<string>I am she. Come in, be welcome.
<string>I've heard how you saved Nona and Y'sai.<lf>Thank you.
<string>We're just glad they're safe. Thank you for inviting<lf>us into your village.
<string>I wish we could be better hosts, but the Sandtide<lf>approaches...and we are busy readying for the storm.
<string>The sands come alive this time of year,<lf>like a wild beast bristling with lightning.
<string>Once your business here is concluded,<lf>you should find shelter.
<string>Before that, we'd like to ask you something.
<string>Have you ever heard of a people known as<lf>the Keepers? We're trying to locate this boy's home.
<string>Keepers? No, I can't say the name is familiar.
<string>But child, you're so young... How did you—<lf>Ah, forgive me. I should not ask such painful questions.
<string>It's all right. Thank you so much for your time.
<string>Hello. Can we speak to the Elder of this village?
<string>Yes, of course. Welcome. Please,<lf>make yourselves comfortable.
<string>We were just about to have a chat.
<string>I've heard how you saved Nona and Y'sai.<lf>Thank you.
<string>We're just glad they're safe. Thank you<lf>for inviting us into your village.
<string>I wish we could be better hosts, but the Sandtide<lf>approaches, and we are busy readying for the storm.
<string>The sands come alive this time of year,<lf>like a wild beast bristling with lightning.

<string>But child, you're so young... How did you—<lf>Ah, forgive me. I should not ask such painful questions.
<string>It's all right. Thank you so much for your time.
<string>I'm sorry I couldn't be of more help to you. If<lf>your business here is done, head on back home.
<string>We will. Thank you for your time.
<string>Seeing a child his age, apart from his homeland...<lf>No, I'm certain he has his reasons. Do be safe.
<string>Nata, let's look around the village some more.
<string>Did you see which direction Gemma went?
<string>She was looking at those stones before.
<string>Hello there. What gentle creatures these are.<lf>Do you ever put them out to pasture?
<string>Yes, but we can't this time of year.
<string>Why is that?
<string>There's not enough for them to graze on right now,<lf>and it's a predatory season for other monsters.
<string>I see! Well, no wonder you keep them here, then.<lf>Thank you for the information.
<string>The storm's not far off now. I need to make sure<lf>it's as comfortable as I can for these guys.
<string>They want to go outside as much as any of us, but<lf>it's dangerous during the Fallow, you know?
<string>I think it's time we headed over to Y'sai's house.
<string>Hi there. What's that you're makin'?
<string>I'm using this stone to craft gemchimes.<lf>These are what keep the village safe.
<string>I can tell you're quite the artisan.<lf>Thanks for showin' me.
<string>Do our gemchimes interest you, traveler? Heh heh.
<string>A precious thing, the gemchimes. Keep our village<lf>safe. Without them, Kunafa could not exist.
<string>I'm not sure what that big tool you carry is, but<lf>am I right that it's there to keep something safe?
<string>Visitors are rare here. Multiple visitors with an<lf>interest in the stones, rarer still.
<string>Oh yeah... I guess they don't see<lf>many Felynes around here.
<string>Rounded cone, wind-resistant structure...<lf>And gemchime stones as trim... Heh, beautiful!
<string>They've got those gemchime stones strung up all<lf>through the village... Must be important to them.
<string>And did you get a look at that cheese? Amazing,<lf>right? ...Ugh, I'm starting to get hungry.
<string>Hey there. What's this?
<string>Hm? You've never seen someone<lf>use Wylkdrops before?
<string>Yo, Hunter. What'd you find?
<string>Hang on, what is this? How does it work?<lf>Can you show me?
<string>Uh...it's called Wylk.<lf>You just...toss it into the fire.
<string>Huh? Did you see that?<lf>It flared up like some kinda fuel...
<string>Definitely something strange about it, though.
<string>I'm surprised to see <ITALIC>you</ITALIC> so surprised. It's just<lf>normal, everyday Wylk?
<string>Just where did you all come from? It must be far,<lf>if you can't find Wylkdrops there.
<string>You're right. We came from the distant west.
<string>Huh... Never heard about a village that far out.
<string>Have you had a chance to ask<lf>the Elder about the Keepers yet?
<string>Hi again! I just had to come back for another look.
<string>You're very fond of rocks and minerals,<lf>aren't you?
<string>Well, something tells me that makes two of us.
<string>You ready to head over to Y'sai's place?
<string>We're ready for you. Come on inside.
<string><COLOR FF0000>#Rejected#</COLOR> Dia_stCh01_Ms001070_0285_t001
<string>Nonsense. We're delighted to have you.
<string>It didn't feel right parting the way we did.
<string>We sighted a large monster...
<string>What's this about a sandstorm?
<string>Do you know anything about Nata's home?
<string>(End Conversation)
<string>We sighted a monster with long, thick fur near the village.
<string><COLOR FF0000>#Rejected#</COLOR> Dia_stCh01_Ms001070_0290_t011a
<string>That sounds like a Doshaguma. They never<lf>used to venture out of the forest...
<string>There's a forest?
<string>Yes, up the river and beyond the grasslands.
<string>We've been encountering Doshaguma a lot recently.<lf>They attack our livestock, so we keep them penned up here.
<string>Fortunately, the gemchimes protect us.
<string>A bunch of ornaments make ya feel safe?
<string>Yes, you see, this region is home to a creature<lf>that even the Doshaguma fear.
<string>And it just so happens that the gemchime stones<lf>sound a lot like that monster.
<string>And that's enough of a deterrent... Interesting.
<string>What's this about an approaching sandstorm?
<string>It'll be here before long, and we have to<lf>make sure the village is prepared.
<string><COLOR FF0000>#Rejected#</COLOR> Dia_stCh01_Ms001070_0290_t027b
<string>I'm told that there's intense lightning<lf>as well as wind. It must be an ordeal.
<string>Yes, but one that the village needs in order to survive.
<string>What do you mean?
<string>After the sandstorm comes the new spring,<lf>when life is restored to all the earth.
<string>You can't mean the wasteland out there?
<string>I do. And our patience is rewarded<lf>with a season of bounty.
<string>I heard that Nata has been searching<lf>for his people, the brave child.
<string>They're called the Keepers. Have you heard of them?
<string>How I wish I could say I have, but I have not.
<string>You must miss your people.
<string>I do, with all my heart.
<string>I don't know if I have a home left to return to...<lf>but I have to believe they're OK.
<string>I suppose we'll take our leave now. Thank you<lf>for the wonderful food and company.
<string>There's no rush for you to leave.
<string>That's very kind, but we know how much<lf>preparing you have to do for the sandstorm.
<string>Thanks for the grub. Best I've had in ages!
<string>I feel more ready to hunt than ever!
<string>Thank you.
<string>Thank you!
<string>Let's start heading back to Base Camp.
<string>So, what's next?
<string>Let's head to the forest.
<string>Right, and maybe we should look into the Doshaguma<lf>while we're at it.
<string>But for today, let's rest. We can start our investigation<lf>fresh tomorrow.
<string>Nata can ride with me. How 'bout we meet up<lf>on the path to the forest and go from there?
<string>Perfect. See you all tomorrow, then.
<string>OK, let's head to the forest. Gemma and Nata<lf>said they'll catch up.
<string>You're an...unfamiliar face. Where are you from?
<string>What? Interested in the stones, are you?
<string>I'd love to offer you a good, long look, but...<lf>I'm sorry, there's just no time now.
<string>The Seikret you rode in on...<lf>Wasn't that our famed wild child?
<string>Wait, so that means you're the<lf>one Y'sai was talking about.
<string>That's a good Seikret. Smart as anything,<lf>and fast as the wind itself.
<string>Not to mention proud. You might say<lf>that one's...<ITALIC>disinclined</ITALIC> to listen to us.
<string>Seikret are family, no less than our human kin.<lf>Look after yours well, won't you?
<string>You have my word.
<string>W-Wait, who... Who are you? I-I'm sorry,<lf>I really need to get this done.
<string>Making cheese is—it's a complicated process.<lf>Look, I'm sorry...
<string>Cheese can be preserved and stored, so we make as<lf>much as we can before the Sandtide comes.
<string>Which is, um... Why I need to hurry, and... Sorry.
<string>You seem quite busy.
<string>Oh, I am. There are preparations for the Sandtide,<lf>and I need to mind my grandson, besides.
<string>Have you come from another village, then? Rare<lf>thing, seeing people walking about in this season.
<string>You should get back home while it's still safe.
