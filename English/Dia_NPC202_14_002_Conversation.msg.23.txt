<string>As I understand it, your kind and ours, once<lf>sundered, now have come again to meet.
<string>Ours is surely a reunion eons in the making.
<string>Having weathered too many a storm, the Wyverians<lf>from the capital sought a land of calm to end their days.
<string>From then on they remained.<lf>Such is how Suja came to be.
<string>Ah. Welcome, child.
<string>Come, be seated.
<string>...
<string>Ah. Welcome, child.
<string>Is Nata well?
<string>I expect that Wounded Hollow would be a place<lf>of great interest to you, as well.
<string>Go where your heart bids you, child. That, too,<lf>is a part of life.
<string>There is no good nor ill in the whisperings that<lf>reach my ears.
<string>There is no good nor ill in the whisperings that<lf>reach my ears.
<string>The wings that carry you are strong indeed!
<string>Is Nata well? Good. If you would be so kind,<lf>tell him this—
<string>"It matters not how far one flies, so long as they<lf>fly on their own wings."
<string>I suspect those words may find a home in his heart.
<string>Suja is...a place of harsh memories for past<lf>Allhearkens and other Wyverians.
<string>After being worshiped then discarded by those<lf>of the capital, we found a new home in exile.
<string>A land that swallowed our grief and anger... It<lf>taught us even that was a part of the ecosystem.
<string>I'm pleased you've come, young bird.
