<string>...Nh!? Oh, it's you, Hunter... My apologies.
<string>You seem pretty on edge. Has something happened?
<string>Monsters have been coming closer to the village<lf>lately. So I've been on alert.
<string>Monsters, here? Why would they suddenly come<lf>so close?
<string>The Allhearken said some monsters at the<lf>Iceshard Cliffs have been raging recently.
<string>They've chased the others off, and now we're<lf>seeing the results of that here.
<string>I see... That's concerning.
<string>If the need arises, we can fortify the gate and<lf>weather it. The Keepers, though...
<string>Right. And considering the cause, this is a<lf>problem that could worsen before it gets better.
<string>Will you allow us to look into the matter?
<string>Yes, I would be very grateful. And rest assured,<lf>I'll keep this place safe in the meantime.
<string>I heard you were able to resolve the situation at<lf>the Iceshard Cliffs for us, Hunter.
<string>Yes. We found two monsters clashing there.<lf>They were in quite a frenzy.
<string>The scale and severity of their effect on the<lf>surrounding area was clear. But it's dealt with.
<string>I see... That's a relief. Thank you.
<string>We still struggle to understand just how hunting<lf>such monsters ties to harmonious coexistence...
<string>But that's something for us to keep pondering.<lf>For now, I can at least get proper sleep again.
<string>It's not much of a reward for your work, but I'd<lf>like to continue to help even more where I can.
<string>If there are any materials you need, feel free to<lf>ask anytime.
