<string>Zatoh, what's the situation?
<string>Chaotic. We cannot unravel why the Sandtide<lf>is happening again so soon!
<string>We intend to go to the eye of the storm. There's<lf>a good chance the monster we're after is there.
<string>The eye of the storm? You mean the Wind's Gasp.<lf>No telling what terror awaits you there.
<string>Still, I shall not dissuade you from your calling.<lf>May the wind guide your heart true.
<string>Thank you. We head to the Wind's Gasp.

<string>This isn't the way to the Wind's Gasp.
<string>The Wind's Gasp is out the other way.
<string>Don't worry. Zatoh will watch over the village.
<string>The White Wraith arrived during the Downpour.<lf>The sandstorm might attract it too.
<string>It's not much of a lead, but it's the best one<lf>we've got.
<string>Our objective is the Wind's Gasp!
<string>We need to go to the Wind's Gasp!
<string>I see it!
<string>Something's definitely not right...
<string>Look at all the Ceratonoth.
<string>Talioths, too.
<string>They're all fleeing... That's telling.
<string>Based on the Ceratonoth's reaction, this must<lf>be the right place.
<string>Yeah, we should hurry to the Wind's Gasp.
<string>All this wind and lightning!
<string>Watch yourselves now!
<string>Are you sure this is the right way?
<string>Check the map if you get lost!
<string>Hear that?
<string>Whatever made that sound is not happy.
<string>We're almost to the heart of the mountain!
<string>Stay on your toes.
<string>In order to protect the surrounding population,<lf>the Guild authorizes you to hunt Rey Dau.
<string>Understood. I'm on it.
<string>In pursuit!
<string>Blast, it's heading toward the others!
<string>The others should be at the camp beneath the oasis.
<string>Got it.
<string>The target is moving toward the summit<lf>of the Wind's Gasp!
<string>Understood. On my way!
<string>This whole area is charged with electricity.<lf>Proceed carefully.
<string>Right.
<string>It's storing up lightning? I think it's going<lf>to unleash an attack!
<string>Hey, did you see that? After it discharged all<lf>that lightning, its head was left wide open!
<string>Kunafa is in danger with that monster on the loose.<lf>Accept the quest when you're ready.
<string>I'm sorry that I can't offer my support, at a time<lf>like this. But I'm sure Erik is more than capable.
<string>I'll stay with Nata to ensure that he doesn't<lf>reach for a weapon again.
<string>...I hope that he understands the difference<lf>between the weapon you wield and what he tried to do.
<string>And I hope that I was right to stop him.
<string>This world is full of countless different "normals."<lf>All I can do is ask myself what it is that I believe in.
<string>Back there, Erik spoke of "energy absorption."
<string>Do you suppose that's the White Wraith's aim in<lf>seeking out the Downpour and Sandtide?
<string>Hunter...
<string>I...
<string>...
<string>Well done! Whew, that was one heck of a monster.
<string>Should we go find the others? They should still<lf>be at the Pop-up Camp.
<string>What does it mean?
<string>I'm just gonna toss this out there, but...
<string>I think this and the sandstorm might be connected?<lf>Ha ha, silly, right?
<string>No, it's a real possibility.
<string>We should tell Werner what we found.
<string>Good idea. But do you mind if we<lf>stop by Kunafa before we go?
<string>I'd like to check in on everyone.<lf>Zatoh must also be worried.
<string>Yeah. Good call.
<string>Erik and I will take Nata back to Base Camp.<lf>Let's join up later.
<string>What an ordeal... And that monster you faced!
<string>The Elder has spoken of its fearsomeness and how<lf>it influenced our use of gemchimes.
<string>Between the wounded Rey Dau and its attacker...
<string>If either had reached the village— I do not have<lf>the words to thank you for what you have done.
<string>The White Wraith retreated to the Oilwell Basin,<lf>but we don't know any more than that.
<string>Erik seemed convinced that what we saw was<lf>the White Wraith absorbing elemental energy.
<string>It's a lot to chew on, but our first order of business<lf>should be to talk to Werner.
