<string>Right, there it is.
<string>Target sighted.
<string>Let's get fired up.
<string>Ready to roll?
<string>Engaging the target.
<string>Heading in!
<string>You're kidding me...!
<string>Sorry, I think I'm out...
<string>Now I've done it...
<string>Sorry for the wait...!
<string>I'm back!
<string>Explosives planted.
<string>Bomb, set and ready.
<string>Trap installed and ready!
<string>The trap's all set to go.
<string>You good to go?
<string>There, you're all set.
<string>A little boost for you!
<string>OK, let's up the pace!
<string>Flash incoming!
<string>Get flash bombed!
<string>Sonic bomb!
<string>Time for a little noise!
<string>Here comes a dung pod!
<string>I'll make 'em move with a dung pod!
<string>Hey, shake it off!
<string>Steady, steady!
<string>This isn't over yet!
<string>No, get clear!
<string>Don't let that hit you!
<string>Thanks for the assist.
<string>Seriously, thank you.
<string>You really saved me.
<string>OK, we're on track.
<string>Almost there, let's stay sharp.
<string>It's caught. Now!
<string>That's our cue!
<string>It's on the ground!
<string>Been waiting for this!
<string>OK, I'm on it!
<string>You're NOT shaking me!
<string>Let's get after it.
<string>Tailing the target.
<string>Sorry, I'm the clingy type.
<string>Where do you think it's headed?
<string>That's that, then. Nice work.
<string>Guess that mission's complete.
<string>Call me again sometime.
<string>I'm feeling good today.
<string>Impressive! As usual!
<string>So few surprises, I'm shocked.
<string>I'd say we make a pretty good team.
<string>You're kind of a monster yourself, huh?
<string>Hey, we got the job done. I'll take it.
<string>Phew, that was a little close.
<string>Alright, I'm ducking out here.
<string>You've got things from here.
