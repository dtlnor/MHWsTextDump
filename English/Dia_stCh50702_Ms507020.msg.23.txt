<string>Hello there. And just in time. I have a little<lf>favor I'd like to ask you.
<string>Remember the Alpha Doshaguma you hunted a<lf>fair while back? We've learned a lot from it.
<string>But I'm still a bit short on evidence to back<lf>my current theory. I'd love a little more data.
<string>I'm sorely tempted to go and collect it myself,<lf>but I admit it's outside of my capabilities.
<string>That awareness is as surprising as it is welcome.
<string>Hahaha. Anyway, I'd like you to capture a solitary<lf>specimen from the forest. One with no pack.
<string>Comparing that to the other alpha should<lf>help to improve our understanding.
<string>I'm in no hurry, though. Feel free to take<lf>this on at your own leisure. I appreciate it.
<string>Thanks for capturing that Doshaguma! I immediately<lf>immersed myself in the analysis.
<string>Doshaguma are fairly individualistic to begin with.<lf>They don't exhibit the collectivism of a true "pack."
<string>In the first place, they're each strong enough to<lf>survive alone. Not many predators to fear, either.
<string>Which is why those in the forest live alone. And<lf>the desert packs lack any real order or cohesion.
<string>In other words, they group purely to hunt. The tie<lf>that binds them is profit—they want a free meal!
<string>Even an average specimen can secure prey it could<lf>never hunt alone, if it aligns with a strong alpha.
<string>I see.
<string>At first, I'd considered cohesion driven by fear<lf>of the dominant alpha, but nope. Just didn't click.
<string>If anything, the pack growing stronger would invite<lf>power struggles and decrease cohesion... Of course!
<string>I'll need to study pack-alpha interactions up<lf>close... Or no, compare forest and desert specimens—
<string>Erik? I need to...
<string>Mm? Ah! Sorry, of course. This stuff just grabs<lf>ahold of me.
<string>Ahh, the ecosystem here truly is a marvel! Don't<lf>you think!?
<string>Uh, yeah...well, glad I could be of help.
