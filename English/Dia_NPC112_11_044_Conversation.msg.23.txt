<string>As you can see, I have my hands full.
<string>I've got cheese to mind.
<string>I make this cheese for everyone. And no, "samples"<lf>are not allowed.
<string>I was taught that nature has her fangs, and that<lf>our part is to accept whatever comes.
<string>But it seems you see the world a little<lf>differently.
<string>I'm teaching the young ones how to make cheese.
<string>I hope they come to actually enjoy the process.
<string>I am always shocked to see how your path leads<lf>you to act. It's so different from our lives here.
<string>Have you tried the cheese we make here yet?
<string>Tasty, isn't it? One of our most popular exports,<lf>I'll have you know.
<string>I've told my kids a thousand times not to go<lf>sneaking bites of the cheese.
<string>But then not even five minutes later, they're at<lf>it again! Maybe it's <ITALIC>too</ITALIC> good.
<string>Do you enjoy this journey of yours?<lf>It's not too hard?
<string>I suppose we all deal with our share of hardships<lf>though. People are good at adapting.
<string>Thinking back, I don't think I've ever taken life<lf>this seriously before...
<string>But I figure we have no guarantee on tomorrow.<lf>We have to learn to accept whatever comes.
<string>Accept and adapt.
