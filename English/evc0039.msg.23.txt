<string>Ugh, brushing elbows with death...
<string>(ground rumbling)
<string>That Wudwud!<lf>Now was NOT the time!
<string>Unbelievable...
<string>How's it even walking on this mess!?
<string>Stay ahead of it!
<string>Ice?
<string>It's freezing the ground to secure its footing!
<string>We have to stop it!
