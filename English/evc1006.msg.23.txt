<string>No sign of Gogmazios, sir.
<string>Mm.
<string>Check your posts. Stay vigilant.
<string>Yes sir.
<string>Are we set?
<string>Working on it. We'll make it.
<string>Werner, you've done enough. Get to your posts.
<string>Once that thing shows up, it'll be too late.
<string>Desi, do what she says.
<string>Huh?
<string>Werner!
<string>I've got this.
<string>Yeah. Let's go.
<string>Status report.
<string>I didn't find any traces of the target, sir.
<string>Neither did I.
<string>The camp is fully operational.
<string>Smithy team is on track, too.
<string>Desi's been pulled out, but Werner's still in there.
<string>I see.
<string>Do you think Gogmazios moved on?
<string>No...
<string>A giant?
<string>Gogmazios!
<string>Werner, it's time!
<string>It's up to us hunters now to fight tooth and nail.<lf>We'll keep Azuz safe!
<string>Now go!
<string>It's almost done. I HAVE to do this!
<string>We can't let Gogmazios near them!
<string>Hurry!
<string>OK, this should do it!
<string>Nadia!
<string>Now aren't you glad I showed up?
<string>
<string>Let's do this!
<string>Well done!
<string>All units, positions!
<string>Got it!
<string>Smithy team, get to cover!
<string>Mina, Kai, follow me!
<string>Yes sir!
<string>We're there!
<string>Our objective is to slay Gogmazios!
<string>Begin by knocking that weapon loose!
