<string>I'm still quite inexperienced at handling Wyvern<lf>Milk. I spend my days assisting the others here.
<string>Not that anyone requires much assistance. Things<lf>are just as they ever were.
<string>What is the Keepers' mission, you ask? I don't<lf>quite know how to reply... We simply <ITALIC>are.</ITALIC>
<string>We live out our lives here as we always have.<lf>I'm afraid I've no exciting answer to offer you.
<string>Your people asked my opinion of the outside world.<lf>I haven't one, really. I've only just learned of it.
<string>Did you truly come from the outside? Where exactly<lf>is that, "outside"?
<string>From what point on does it become so? Is there<lf>a clear boundary there? If so, who decided it?
<string>I simply do not know.
<string>Oh yes, today is quite the same as any other.<lf>...Ought it not be so?
<string>No, forget I asked. Just, please try not to<lf>leave the village today.
<string>I was told the Keepers' reports to the Allhearken<lf>ended quite some time ago.
<string>We still have yet to send word of that Guardian<lf>destroying the village...
<string>Though the path was neither easy nor often trod,<lf>we long made a custom of sending reports.
<string>Now that we are unable to do so, our hearts are<lf>gripped by a heavy guilt.
<string>You said you mean to "investigate" the Guardians?
<string>But their kind is meant only to be watched over.<lf>What do you intend to do, exactly? And why?
<string>Zoh Shia? Yes, we are aware of it. The research<lf>records include its mention.
<string>It is a Guardian of long, long ago, never again<lf>to awaken, correct?
<string>Whyever do you ask?
<string>Pardon. I heard tell of what you have done.
<string>You will have to forgive me. The matter was so<lf>complex that I wasn't sure how I ought to feel.
<string>I simply wish to live the same as we always have...
<string>Nothing ever changes here. I do not wish it<lf>to change.
<string>The greens have been growing slower as of late.
<string>Nata seems almost a person from the outside now.<lf>Yet he is a Keeper. Why?
<string>Are people allowed to simply change<lf>their way of life?
<string>The future is shaped only by the accumulation<lf>of brief moments... So the Allhearken spoke.
<string>But what is this "future"?
<string>Nothing ever changes here. I do not wish it to<lf>change. Though...
<string>Is it true that Arkveld destroyed in an instant<lf>the normal life we built over a thousand years?
<string>What are we to do now? How are we to know which<lf>answer is correct?
