<string>Ugh, my glasses... I can't believe I lost them!
<string>Uh, aren't they on your face?
<string>No, not these. My special glasses.<lf>I must've dropped them.
<string>Gemma made them for me with some materials she<lf>got from the Stonefolk. They were quite stunning...
<string>They had stylish frames and crystal-clear lenses.<lf>Sturdy, too. Truly a visionary masterpiece!
<string>But now they're gone! So much for my dream<lf>of them ending up in a museum one day...
<string>Hmmmm... Any idea where you dropped them?
<string>It must have been while I was out investigating<lf>the Scarlet Forest.
<string>Come to think of it, there were some Wudwuds<lf>around.
<string>Let's see if we can track them down.<lf>They might know something.
<string>Really!? Thank you so much!
<string>Well, we can't allow Alma's dreams to be dashed!<lf>Let's go find them!
<string>No mistaking it, those are definitely my glasses!
<string>Looks like it went towards its hideout.
<string>Was that Wudwud...wearing glasses?
<string>Looks like it went towards its hideout.
<string>My glasses!
<string>Should we ask about the glasses?
<string><COLOR preset="TXT_Danger">Red searchings</COLOR>? I see nothing.<lf>You ask other Wudwuds.
<string>Best time for listenings is forest's plentiful time.<lf>We have big festivations at night. You come then.
<string>You come for listenings about <COLOR preset="TXT_Danger">red searchings</COLOR>?<lf>Then aim for up.
<string>Up vines is our festivations.<lf>Many Wudwuds there.
<string><COLOR preset="TXT_Danger">Red sparklies</COLOR>? Yes, I see!

<string>I think there's some noise coming from downstream.
<string>I hear something from downstream.
<string>What is it? Do you have searchings?
<string>You searching for <COLOR preset="TXT_Danger">forgottenings</COLOR>?<lf>We pick up findings from this river.
<string>But, water flows. You go to water end and<lf>do searchings there.
<string>We want <COLOR preset="TXT_Danger">red good things</COLOR>...
<string>Sparkly <COLOR preset="TXT_Danger">red good things</COLOR> come here.
<string>Wudwud over there said so. They are down<lf>the small road at end.

<string>We want <COLOR preset="TXT_Danger">sparkly red ones</COLOR>. Not fair.
<string>Who there? Why you disturb...?
<string>Sorry to bother you, but that pair of glasses...<lf>We've been looking for them.
<string>We'd be grateful if you could return them to us.
<string>Glassassess MINE! You want? We make tradings.
<string>You bring exquisitous honey. We make deal.
<string>Do you mean eastern honey?
<string>Yes, yes! Most exquisitous!
<string>Oh, you... You bring exquisitous honey?
<string>Here's your eastern honey.
<string>Sorry, not yet.
<string>Tradings done! Here. Take glassassesses!
<string>Lyings are bad.
<string>You find honey! You bring here!
<string>My glasses! They're safe! Oh, thank you,<lf>thank you so much!
<string>I'll never lose them again. They're going in the<lf>back of my drawer until the museum wants them!
<string>What good are they collecting dust?<lf>You should wear them.
<string>You make a compelling point!
<string>Alright, just say the word, and I'll put them<lf>on for all the world to see!
