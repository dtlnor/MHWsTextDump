<string>Ramen... I've gotta eat ramen!
<string>Avis Hunter! Ramen!!!
<string>Uh, "ramen" to you too.
<string>No, you don't understand. If I don't eat<lf>a bowl soon, I'm gonna lose my mind!
<string>That fierce, furr-lavorful soup.<lf>Those smooth, chewy noodles!
<string>And don't even get me started on the secret<lf>spicy red sauce. Dear Gog, I want it meow!
<string>Yeah, it's a shame the Grand Hub has<lf>already rationed out all its portions.
<string>Oh, I'm fully prepared to make it myself.
<string>But every batch I've made, the soup just doesn't<lf>deliver the savory punch I'm looking for.
<string>So, I twisted my whiskers...and then it hit me!
<string>What I need is...Poogie.
<string>Do I even want to ask for what?
<string>Oh, Poogie's an extremely vital part<lf>of the process. Trust me...
<string>I, uh, guess I'll help you...find one, then?
<string>Really? What a pal you are, Hunter.<lf>All compassion and kindness.

<string>Time to rustle up one Poogie, I guess.<lf>It must be around here somewhere...
<string>I should search inside the Grand Hub.
<string>Poog...poogie...
<string>I can hear it. I'm getting warm.
<string>Poog, poogie.
<string>Poogie! Poogie!
<string>It's close by.
<string>The Poogie should be somewhere in the Grand Hub.<lf>It's got an important role, after all.
<string>
<string>
<string>Poogie!
<string>Argh! It got away.
<string>Don't tell me it fell into the water?
<string>Poogieee!
<string>Oh no! I have to save it!
<string>That Poogie plopped into the water with<lf>the speed of a raging Nargacuga.
<string>Guess something must've gotten it all hot and sweaty.
<string>If you're looking for that Poogie,<lf>it went rocketing off toward the waterfall.
<string>It sure has a lot of energy.<lf>Something must've lifted its spirits.
<string>Poogie!
<string>Gah, lost it again.
<string>Must be headed for higher ground.
<string>Poogieee!?
<string>Pfoogie? Mrrf...urrf...
<string>Poogie, no!
<string>Um...pardon me.
<string>♪♪♪ ?
<string>I have a really, really important favor to ask.
<string>Could you please release that Poogie?
<string>Let that Poogie go right now...or else!
<string>♪♪！　♪♪♪！！
<string>♪ . . . ♪♪♪～！
<string>OK, Poogie acquired.
<string>Hm? Are these...herbs?
<string>You found the Poogie! And...are these<lf>the herbs I need? Wow, thanks!
<string>I was gonna ask that Poogie to get these for me.<lf>They'll take the gaminess out of the soup.
<string>Poogie!
<string>O-Oh! Yeah. Of course! I mean...pfft.<lf>I knew that was your intention all along.
<string>Alrighty. Let's give this recipe a whirl!

<string>How's it taste, Hunter?
<string>Not bad. Not bad—
<string>I knew it was useless! I'll never experience<lf>that purrfect savoriness again...
<string>Never say never!
<string>We've got the ramen you seek right here!
<string>This is it... The flavor I've been longing fur...
<string>I've never felt so renewed.
<string>We heard you've been busting your tail trying<lf>to replicate our flavor. Good for you!
<string>Don't blame yourself for coming up short. Only four<lf>people in the world know the exact recipe.
<string>Still, we can't let your efforts go unrewarded.
<string>We'll pull a few strings and work with the Guild so<lf>your Supply Ship can deliver our secret ingredients!
<string>Really? Meow-hooooo!
<string>Poogie!
<string>Feel free to come eat here any time<lf>if you get your hands on an order form.
<string>We'll be looking forward to your next visit!
