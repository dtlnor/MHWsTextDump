<string>On my way there!
<string>This way? You got it.
<string>That's our target, huh?
<string>Oh, so that's our target now?
<string>I'll go on ahead, then.
<string>Over here! C'mon!
<string>We can get the materials we need over here!
<string>There's a monster here...
<string>Monster ahead... Better stay quiet.
<string>Guess I got here first.
<string>Destination reached!
<string>Rendezvous complete!
<string>I'll ride with you.
<string>Mind if I hop on?
<string>Thanks for the lift!
<string>Should I come, too?
<string>Wow, we sure got here fast.
<string>I'll just hop off for now...
<string>This must be how the wind feels.
<string>Can't go back after riding one of these...
<string>Calm the mind...and focus.
<string>Never got the hang of patience.
<string>Whatcha think we'll find?
<string>Aaand yoink!
<string>Curiosity sure paid off this time!
<string>Ooh! I think we can mine this!
<string>Don't mind if I do... Heh heh.
<string>You can use your Slinger now!
<string>The key to fishing...is patience.
<string>My whiskers are tingling... Weather's changing.
<string>Gah! I can't see past my whiskers!
<string>Meowch! My tail's on fire!
<string>I think these might be tracks?
<string>Wonder if there's anything good around here...
<string>Wonder if this could be useful.
<string>I'll get ready, too.
<string>Our destination's just a quick hop from here.
<string>Careful we don't get sucked in!
<string>I guess it leads down here...
<string>The terrain here looks like a natural trap.
<string>The perfect char!
<string>Doesn't look half bad!
<string>It's not too bad this way!
<string>Time for a true master angler to shine!
<string>Fishing's all patience!
<string>Wow, what a view!
<string>The eastern lands are a wild place, huh?
<string>Sure are a lot of monsters there.
<string>I spy an ancient relic.
