<string>On my way there!
<string>This way? You got it.
<string>That's our target, huh?
<string>Oh, so that's our target now?
<string>Let's go hear what they have to say.
<string>I'll go on ahead, then.
<string>Over here! C'mon!
<string>We can get the materials we need over here!
<string>There's a monster here...
<string>Monster ahead... Better stay quiet.
<string>Guess I got here first.
<string>Destination reached!
<string>Rendezvous complete!
<string>I'll ride with you.
<string>Mind if I hop on?
<string>Thanks for the lift!
<string>Should I come, too?
<string>Wow, we sure got here fast.
<string>I'll just hop off for now...
<string>This must be how the wind feels.
<string>Can't go back after riding one of these...
<string>Calm the mind...and focus.
<string>Never got the hang of patience.
<string>Whatcha think we'll find?
<string>Aaand yoink!
<string>Curiosity sure paid off this time!
<string>Ooh! I think we can mine this!
<string>Don't mind if I do... Heh heh.
<string>You can use your Slinger now!
<string>The key to fishing...is patience.
<string>My whiskers are tingling... Weather's changing.
<string>Gah! I can't see past my whiskers!
<string>Ugh, I hate getting wet...
<string>My fur isn't built for this kinda weather.
<string>My whiskers are turning into icicles.
<string>That light...so pretty...
<string>Meowch! My tail's on fire!
<string>I think these might be tracks?
<string>Wonder if there's anything good around here...
<string>Wonder if this could be useful.
<string>I'll get ready, too.
<string>Our destination's just a quick hop from here.
<string>Careful we don't get sucked in!
<string>I guess it leads down here...
<string>Yikes, that's some current...!
<string>The terrain here looks like a natural trap.
<string>Meow, so tasty!
<string>Doesn't look half bad!
<string>It's not too bad this way!
<string>Time for a true master angler to shine!
<string>Fishing's all patience!
<string>Wow, what a view!
<string>The eastern lands are a wild place, huh?
<string>Sure are a lot of monsters there.
<string>I spy an ancient relic.
<string>Look at all our ingredients! We should whip out<lf>the BBQ Grill.
<string>Hey, is that your stomach gurr-owlin'?
<string>Researching Endemic Life is part of<lf>a hunter's duty, you know!
<string>A Giant Vigorwasp. I guess they prefer the<lf>Plenty, too.
<string>See that splish-splashing over there?<lf>That's a sign of fish gathering!
<string>The lightning is sparking up the insects.<lf>We might be able to use them as traps!
<string>I bet we could use those floating rocks<lf>up there to our advantage.
<string>Yikes, spikes! Those could<lf>come in handy on a hunt.
<string>This is so cozy! Thank you!
<string>It's so soft and... zzz...
<string>This is some tough competition!
<string>You're number one! That's amazing!
<string>You beat your old record!
<string>Number one! That's what I'm talking about!
<string>Nicely done! We'll do even better next time!
<string>That was fun! When do we go again?
<string>Woohoo! I looove fishing!
<string>Winner takes all, partner!
<string>My partner's the best around!
<string>Well fought, partner!
<string>There you go! Easy now!
<string>Whoa! Look at you go!
<string>Haa... That was dreamy.
<string>I hope she sings that again.
<string>They're doing some kind of event in the Grand Hub!<lf>Let's go check it out!
<string>Ooh! This is gonna be fun!
<string>I search...for those stronger than me.
<string>Whoooa! It's huge!
<string>Fireworks are so magical.
<string>The Hub's a-buzzin'!
<string>A little gathering goes a long way.
<string>Amaaazing! It's perfect!
<string>Maybe I should change up my look, too?
<string>You lined that up perfectly!
<string>Plenty of fish in the sea.
<string>It's getting tired! Crank that reel!
<string>*sniff*... Wh-What's that smell?
<string>Bleagh! My nose is on fire!
<string>There, huh? OK!
