<string>Wait, Hunter. We're going this way.
<string>This may not be the right direction.
<string>I don't think our destination is that way.
<string>Let's double-check our destination.
<string>For the time being, let's head for our destination.
<string>We're heading away from our destination.
<string>That way leads to a different area.
<string>We're pretty far off now.
<string>We should concentrate on our mission.
<string>Let's go there after we complete our mission.
<string>We should head back and meet up with the others.
<string>Let's go back before we get separated from everyone.
<string>People are waiting on us.
<string>That way leads to where Olivia and the others<lf>are conducting their investigation.
