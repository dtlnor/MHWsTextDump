<string>The Support Team's working at full steam today.
<string>Only the bravest Felynes signed on to enter the<lf>Forbidden Lands as part of the Support Team.
<string>Investigation in the forest going well? Try not<lf>to get too soaked.
<string>I saw some Wudwuds in the forest during the Plenty.<lf>They were going absolutely wild.
<string>There's a saying I've always loved. "The garden<lf>grows greenest after rain's fall."
<string>I'm in charge of the Support Team here<lf>at the Forest Base Camp.
<string>Let's steer clear of rain clouds and red puddles<lf>to make today another dry, productive day.
<string>So there's a tribe of Lynians like us living here?<lf>I'd love the chance to chat with one...
<string>So, this White Wraith... What'd it look like?
<string>Congrats on finishing a whopper of a job, Hunter.
<string>The Wudwuds are just the same as ever, but we all<lf>saw what you did out there.
<string>Yian Kut-ku, living in the Scarlet Forest, huh?<lf>You see a lot of their kind back west.
<string>Not sure why, but my whiskers feel so heavy...<lf>It's not just the humidity, right?
<string>The Wudwuds describe this weather perfectly.<lf>It really is like the bottom fell out of the sky.
<string>Really, really, <ITALIC>reaaally</ITALIC> nice work out there.
<string>Ooh, my whiskies are feeling frisky!
<string>Watching you has got me wanting to leave the<lf>forest to check out the other Base Camps.
<string>...Not <ITALIC>going</ITALIC> to, but hey!
<string>My love for this forest has sparked my curiosity<lf>about what the other Base Camps are like.
