<string>I must be getting old. I get such a chill at night.
<string>In that case, I'll give you some<lf>of the medicinal tea I use.
<string>Ugh, keep it. Your cures are always so bitter.
<string>Lately my eyes have dimmed, and my hands have grown shaky.
<string>Why not get yourself a young apprentice to help out?
<string>Bah! I'm not about to have some brat babysit me.
<string>I hear you got in another argument with<lf>the young folks.
<string>Just look at them! Nothing but trouble.
<string>It is the responsibility of us elders to keep<lf>them in check.
<string>You know, thinking back, the Elder before<lf>last really was a selfish brat.
<string>You're right. We should've given her<lf>what for when we had the chance!
<string>Yeah, just really put it to her!
