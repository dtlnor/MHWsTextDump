<string>I'll go and greet the locals.
<string>Thanks for all your hard work.
<string>Shall we go together?
<string>Thank you for having us.
<string>Were there any issues securing provisions?
<string>Nope, we're all good.
<string>I'm glad to hear it.
<string>Here is the latest report.<lf>Thank you for all your help.
<string>Same to you, miss. You're really helping me out.
<string>I'll be going, then.
<string>Do you mind if I have a look, sir?
<string>...Do as you please.
<string>Thank you very much.
<string>Much appreciated!
<string>Pardon me, would you mind if I watched awhile?
<string>Aren't you a curious one. Go ahead.
<string>Thank you very much.
<string>About how long does it take to complete a piece?
<string>I'd say three seasons of Plenty, give or take.
<string>A lot of care and craft goes into each one, then.
<string>Thank you for your time.
<string>Would it be all right if I listened in as well?
<string>Of course, child.
<string>Thank you for sharing that wonderful story.
<string>They're really getting into it.
<string>Yes. Wonderous dancings. You agree?
<string>I love to see the joy that comes with people<lf>gathering.
<string>This...appears to be a regularly used facility.
<string>Would you mind if I watched you work awhile?
<string>Can't get a hand free right now.
<string>Of course. I won't interrupt your work at all.
<string>Pardon the intrusion.
<string>That's quite the stunning ore sample.
<string>You won't find better quality.
<string>Nor a more skilled artisan to work it, I'm sure.
<string>Thank you for speaking with me.
<string>How does it look?
<string>Still too many impurities.
<string>You must have quite the eye for this.
<string>I appreciate your time.
<string>The village is absolutely bustling.
<string>The tribes are all eager to show off their skills.
<string>We'll really get to see the fruits of Azuz's labor.
<string>Just amazing...
<string>I dropped by to say hello.
<string>Is there anything you need? If so, please don't<lf>hesitate to say.
<string>Thank you for your kind generosity.
<string>Those look delicious.
<string>They're used in dye-making and can be fashioned<lf>into lights as well.
<string>It sounds like they're deeply rooted in your<lf>lives, then.
<string>Thank you for letting me intrude.
<string>There's a clear view of Wyveria from here.
<string>I'll still catch myself staring, sometimes.
<string>Oh, I'm sure. I would lose all track of the time.
<string>I lack the words to describe the beauty here...
<string>I see you use Wyvern Milk in your farming here.
<string>Yes. The trick is in controlling the concentration.
<string>It sounds like quite the delicate task.
<string>Sorry to have interrupted.
