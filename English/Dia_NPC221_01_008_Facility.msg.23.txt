<string>Hm? What's that you say?<lf>You think we've met elsewhere?
<string>Pah... Who knows. If you say so then<lf>we probably have.

<string>Guess that's what you call fate.<lf>The name's Legend.
<string>Though, some call me the Myth of Legend.<lf>Ho ho ho! Just pulling your leg.
<string>Come on over, Hunter.
<string>Hunter, I have suggestions for you.
<string>Let me equip you properly.
<string>You can't hunt in that.
<string>Another satisfied customer.
<string>Oh, good. Very good.
<string>Heh heh heh!
<string>My hammer is yours anytime.
<string>Safe wanderings.
<string>Pah, leaving already?
<string>So, what'll it be?

<string>How's this hit your eye?
<string>This is what you need.

<string>Can I proceed?
<string>Should I begin?
<string>A sage choice.
