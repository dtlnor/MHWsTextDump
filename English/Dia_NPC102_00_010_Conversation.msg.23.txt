<string>A hunter's job is to stay calm no matter what.<lf>Isn't that right?
<string>Deep breaths. I'll be here to help where I can!
<string>Is it just me, or does everything over here<lf>come in gonzo-size only?
<string>Do they not have Felynes here in the East?<lf>What about Poogies, you think?
<string>Guess life's never-ending grind doesn't change<lf>between East and West. I suppose that's obvious.
<string>I'm starting to get a feel for your equipment<lf>tastes, Hunter.
<string>I swear, the world's always twice as big<lf>as you think it is...
<string>I wonder how many times I'll have truly<lf>eye-opening moments before I die.
<string>Sounds like this place has got its own<lf>Training Area.
<string>Upgrade your gear and organize your items now unless<lf>you wanna try reaching for a potion that doesn't exist.
<string>One look at the Seikret and inspiration hit me<lf>like a sledgehammer. So, whatcha think?
<string>We'll catch up later. I'll take Nata with me.
<string>Everything here seems to happen <ITALIC>bigger</ITALIC>.<lf>You notice that?
<string>Nata's said what he wants to do, but it's your call.<lf>Some time watching another hunter could be good.
<string>Huh? So its name is Marianne?<lf>...I, uh, I love it!
<string>OK great, but...a Congalala? Hope you're packing<lf>some deodorants, 'cause, uh...pee-yoo...
<string>The Wudwuds are freakin' weird...and I <ITALIC>like</ITALIC> 'em.
<string>The Elder said something about "the Plenty."<lf>What do you suppose that's about?
<string>I mean, I get it. Weather's gonna do its thing. But<lf>it's not supposed to be on the dot like this, right?
<string>Why does someone else's suffering sting this much?
<string>Off she went. She sure looked pumped up!<lf>Reminds me of me, from back in the day.
<string>All I remember is a voice in my head going,<lf>"Go out there and do stuff!"
<string>Stay calm out there, Hunter. It's times like these<lf>that you need to go in fully prepared.
<string>Check that list: your equipment upgraded?<lf>Items organized? Check and double-check.
<string>I'll bet you anything Werner's sniffed out<lf>something useful. But will he <ITALIC>tell</ITALIC> us?
<string>Is Rove trying to steal my witty banter position?<lf>He's got, like...fur, and that cool hat...
<string>Let me swing around a few thees and thous and...<lf>uh, thuhs... Yeah, I don't know how those work.
<string>Nata's been so gung ho lately. I should have read<lf>the warning signs...
<string>Gahhh, but that's after-the-fact loser talk.<lf>Pull it together, Gemma!
<string>Now that we're getting the big picture, we need<lf>to tread carefully as we keep moving.
<string>Caution is our best friend right now...
<string>White monsters... They kinda give the same<lf>vibe as the White Wraith, don't you think?
<string>We just have to keep on moving forward.
<string>Weren't the Guardians supposed to be non-predatory!?<lf>This is really starting to break my brain.
<string>We already made it this far! I'm fired up and<lf>ready to go.
<string>I'm not gonna flinch. I'm not gonna budge.<lf>Get ready for a Gemma you've never seen.
<string>I can still feel that thing nipping at my calves...
<string>What did the people of Wyveria think would<lf>save them?
<string>If I were alive back then, I guess I might've<lf>prayed for the same thing, but still...
<string>No matter where you go or when you go, people<lf>just repeat the same joy and pain and sadness.
<string>If it's somebody's predator and somebody's prey,<lf>then that makes it just like any other monster.
<string>And if saying that means I'm not being objective<lf>as a Guild member? Then, fine.
<string>Nata deserves at least one more person to hold<lf>on to hope with him.
<string>A hunter's job is to stay calm no matter what.<lf>Isn't that right?
<string>Deep breaths. I'll be here to help where I can!
<string>Heh. The fun's only just beginning here.<lf>I can tell.
<string>Feel like changing things up? How 'bout we set your<lf>Palico up with a new look?
<string>Are these tempered monsters a threat? Yes. Does<lf>knowing that just fire me up more? Also yes.
<string>The whole flow of the energy has changed. Of<lf>course that's gonna have an effect.
<string>How long do you figure this weather will keep up?
<string>Making good use of talismans and decorations? It<lf>takes a little doing, but...
<string>The right loadout will give you the perfect skill<lf>set for your primary <ITALIC>and</ITALIC> secondary weapon types.
<string>Can't hurt. Try messing around with it sometime!
<string>Hey, d'you see? Fabius had a big,<lf>fat grin on his face.
<string>I don't blame him for getting excited. He finally<lf>made it out here.
<string>I'd love to go around giving him the grand tour.
<string>Did I hear right? You found a Frenzied monster?<lf>Hmmm... I see. Alright.
<string>I know the Frenzy pretty well. You'll wanna hold<lf>nothing back on this one.
<string>I gotcha. He's taking the sample back to the<lf>Academy for analysis, yeah?
<string>Then we keep doing what we can here in the meantime,<lf>same as always.
<string>An individual monster tough enough to make it outside of<lf>its usual habitat...
<string>Pretty wild. It's a change I never saw coming.
<string>We've gotta adapt to the changes happening around us,<lf>too. If something's giving you trouble, come see me.
<string>Oh, yeah. Astrum Unit had something to report,<lf>they said.
<string>Heh... Hard not to tense up when the Dragontorch<lf>is involved.
<string>Still, it's times like these the value of steady,<lf>everyday work really shines.
<string>Yeah! You're the one to get it done!
<string>There are a lot of questions to answer here, but the<lf>only way to do that's to get investigating.
<string>So the issue really is the Dragontorch. I bet<lf>Werner's tearing his hair out.
<string>What am I saying? He's probably having a blast...
<string>Gotta say... I'm not a huge fan of this situation.<lf>Well, all we can do is prepare.
<string>If you're headed out scouting, be careful.
<string>If your gear's not right for the situation, adapt.<lf>I'm ready for you anytime.
<string>Seems like everybody's having a rough time of it.<lf>All we can do is try to solve things one by one.
<string>Oh, right. Alma was looking for you.
<string>Something about the Frenzy, she said.
<string>It's been forever since I saw Fabius all decked<lf>out. Just wish it were under better circumstances...
<string>Nobody here knows Gore Magala better than he does,<lf>I can tell you that.
<string>All the more reason not to let him do anything<lf>crazy. I'm counting on you, Hunter.
<string>Phew, what a lifesaver! A whole bunch of problems<lf>should start simmering down now.
<string>You're headed back out though, yeah? Oh, believe<lf>me, I know.
<string>You noticed yet? Nata, I mean. He's started looking<lf>into things on his own.
<string>Makes me feel kinda proud to see.
<string>That Arkveld... It sure is a monster that sticks<lf>with you, huh.
<string>But Nata's grown. He'll get past this. I know you<lf>agree with me there, Hunter.
<string>Nata's really grown into a strong person.
<string>I knew nature was tough, and people, too. This<lf>really drives it home, though.
<string>He's got me feeling all fired up, too. So...!<lf>Let's get to work!
<string>As we gather here together...<lf>bound for fervent fields...
<string>Wish I could go back and tell that to myself earlier.
<string>They may seem like just more monsters, but their<lf>materials are pretty different from ours back west.
<string>Curing, melting points, you name it... Good<lf>news: that means every day's full of discoveries!
<string>The climate's changed, and these diverse monsters<lf>have adapted to it...
<string>As the same living beings, we need to be flexible,<lf>too. How 'bout I make you some new talismans?
