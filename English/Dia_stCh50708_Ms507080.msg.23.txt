<string>Hunter! A humble request for your assistance.
<string>We've received word of Ajarakan rampaging<lf>through the Wounded Hollow.
<string>It is a matter I would gladly resolve myself, but<lf>my other responsibilities have not allowed it...
<string>We have already asked so much of you, but I would<lf>be further still in your debt if you hunted them.
<string>Understood. I'll see it taken care of.
<string>Hearing that, I know the deed is as good as done!<lf>Then take care, and again, my apologies.
<string>Masterful work, Hunter! And with no damage to the<lf>Wounded Hollow or surrounding environs!
<string>You have my sincerest thanks! I can easily see<lf>why you command Sir Fabius's deep trust.
<string>...Though that area seems a veritable<lf>magnet for such difficulties.
<string>It has seen one incident after the next,<lf>with nary a moment's rest between.
<string>I imagine that's why the two<lf>of you were posted here.
<string>...Huh?
<string>As you say, it's a dangerous place.<lf>And important, given how close it is to Suja.
<string>Only natural that he would place his<lf>two best men here to watch over it.
<string>I see... It is just as you say, Hunter. My thanks<lf>for your words of encouragement!
<string>As a Hunter under Sir Fabius's command, I will<lf>redouble my efforts here to live up to them.
<string>I know that my long road to becoming<lf>an Ace Lancer has still only just begun!
