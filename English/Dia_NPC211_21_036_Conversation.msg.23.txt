<string>Even the creatures we've already discovered<lf>are still very much a mystery to us.
<string>The notion of coming to a wholly unknown land<lf>to study unknown beasts might be lunacy.
<string>...But, I suppose that's the nature of the beasts<lf>we call researchers. It's our fate.
<string>Hunter. Faring well, I hope?
<string>Oh, Hunter. Something I can assist you with?
<string>I was just doing a bit of reference reading,<lf>but I'm due a break.
<string>My neck gets stiff if I don't stretch once in<lf>a while.
<string>Hello. I'm Samin, part of the Endemic Life<lf>Research team. A pleasure to work with you.
<string>I'm at the bottom of the food chain around<lf>these parts. Feel free to stop and chat anytime.
<string>We study the local fauna and the traces they leave<lf>as a lens to view the bigger ecological picture.
<string>It's a collective effort, of course...but I still<lf>hope to make a standout contribution.
<string>The cloth-like tail of the Quematrice is certainly<lf>a point of fascination.
<string>Are they born looking like that? Or is it the<lf>product of a lifetime exposure to fire?
<string>We're looking into the Alpha Doshaguma as well.
<string>Unfortunately there's still a lot we don't know...<lf>Please be careful out there, Hunter.
<string>Quite the change of scenery, isn't it?<lf>I'm flabbergasted.
<string>The vast effect this must have on the ecology...<lf>Or rather, this cycle must be an integral part of it.
<string>Rey Dau... The monster harnessing the power<lf>of the Inclemency's storms, yes?
<string>Did it adapt to make use of lightning to survive,<lf>or has it survived because of that characteristic?
<string>A classic chicken-or-the-egg quandary.
<string>Dareel has been clawing through every reference<lf>material in sight.
<string>I know I have no shot at beating him in knowledge,<lf>so my only chance is to think outside the box...
<string>I won't let him open up any more of a gap<lf>between us.
<string>A job well done, Hunter. Though, forgive me—<lf>I suppose your investigation isn't over just yet?
<string>The same is true of our work here. If anything,<lf>this is just the beginning.
<string>Here's to our continued cooperation, friend.
<string>I never imagined I'd have the chance to meet<lf>the famed Fabius... Talk about presence!
<string>You seem awfully busy. Are you resting properly?
<string>I'm still struggling to believe the whole region's<lf>been infected.
<string>As a researcher, it's fascinating. As a guy trying<lf>to stay alive, though... I'm less sold on it.
<string>Truth be told, this is my first assignment so far<lf>from home. I was a bit apprehensive.
<string>Just look around. A walking encyclopedia of a mentor,<lf>and a stubborn ox of a senior. A bit intimidating.
<string>But I'm so glad I came.
<string>The boss is just as unflappable as ever. Do you<lf>suppose I'll be that calm when I'm his age?
<string>...Hmm, I can't even begin to imagine it.
<string>Dareel is an exceptionally talented researcher.<lf>That's clear to anyone who's worked with him.
<string>All the more reason I don't want to lose to him.
<string>Dareel is the very definition of dedication.<lf>I doubt he's ever had a non-work-related thought.
<string>I expect he'd forget to eat and sleep if left<lf>alone.
<string>I wonder if he's eaten today...
<string>Just to avoid any misunderstandings, let me make<lf>it clear that I'm not trying to sabotage Dareel.
<string>It's just that the only way to even keep pace is<lf>to go at him like I'm trying to run the man down.
<string>Personally, I'd love more chances to pick his<lf>brain about his research...
<string>Dareel invited me to join him for a meal the other<lf>day. First time <ITALIC>that's</ITALIC> ever happened.
<string>Not that I minded, of course. I'm just not used<lf>to that sort of thing.
<string>That cheese sure was good.
