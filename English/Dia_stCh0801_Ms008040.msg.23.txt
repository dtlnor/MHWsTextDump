<string>Can I talk to you right quick?<lf>We just got an urgent message.
<string>It seems Olivia has something important<lf>to report about the Dragontorch.
<string>Let's go hear what she has to say.
<string>Thanks for coming. There was something<lf>I wanted to share about the situation here.
<string>Give me a minute to pull everyone together.
<string>So, was there some problem?
<string>You know about the eruptions in this area, right?<lf>Of the energy that the Guardians feed on.
<string>We do. Energy funneled from the Dragontorch<lf>overflows out of these openings, correct?
<string>That's right. I'm not sure if you've noticed, but<lf>they've been going nonstop for a while now.
<string>We still don't know the cause, so don't get<lf>any ideas. Wasn't anything I did.

<string>But the Guardians are feasting well, I'll tell you that.<lf>What that means down the line, we'll have to see.
<string>What worries me most are the Iceshard Cliffs.<lf>The weather there's started going wild, just like here.

<string>Understood. We'll prepare for an emergency<lf>as we continue our regional investigations.
<string>Thanks. We'll keep a close watch here<lf>and do what we can to contain it.
<string>As for everywhere else, I'm afraid we have no<lf>choice but to continue to rely on your Avis Unit.
<string>Not a problem. We're on it.
<string>Let's leave things here to the Astrum Unit and<lf>continue focusing on weather anomalies.
