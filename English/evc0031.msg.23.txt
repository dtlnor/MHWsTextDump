<string>Hey, you mind waiting on those repairs?
<string>We think it's some kind of ancient apparatus.
<string>Right...
<string>Kinda obvious when you look at its guts.
<string>Then let's cut to the chase.<lf>If that thing is some kind of energy conduit,
<string>then the energy won't have anywhere to go if<lf>its pathways are broken.
<string>So...
<string>If all that pent up energy gets released at once,<lf>it'll probably trigger the Firespring.
<string>Well, too late. Repairs are done.
<string>Well, UN-repair it!
<string>Why?
<string>It was broken, now it's not. Pretty sure that's<lf>what these folks want.
<string>We will start the festival ceremonies anew!
<string>No stopping it now.<lf>Not once it starts flowing.
<string>Light it up!
<string>We beckoned the Firespring with our own hands!
<string>NO!
<string>What's happening!?
<string>
<string>The Great Apes!
<string>What is it?
<string>They're here! RIGHT outside!
<string>Now monsters?
<string>Why?
<string>This wasn't supposed to happen...
<string>That's...
<string>ENOUGH! Listen up!
<string>Feeling sorry for yourself won't help!
<string>We have to put our heads together and fix this!
<string>Think. Is there ANYTHING we can do?
<string>Can we quell the fire? Or reroute it?
<string>Yes! The old forge!
<string>It uses a different system!
<string>If we fix it up, we might be able to disperse the fire!
<string>There ya go!
<string>You gonna sit and cry or get up and help?
<string>Let's go!
<string>Let's get this done!
<string>You need to rest!
<string>I'm fine now.
<string>I want to help!
<string>Alright.
<string>Let's go.
<string>OK!
<string>Won't be easy but we're doin' it!
<string>Yes we are.
<string>You guys do your thing.
<string>Let's go. We have our own job to do.
<string>Right!
<string>Azuz is in your hands.
<string>Understood!
