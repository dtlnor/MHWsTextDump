<string>I haven't the words to thank you for saving me from<lf>my latest in nigh two dozen such mishaps.
<string>...Hmm. A strange phrase, that. The words to thank<lf>you are clearly held therein.
<string>Regardless. I vow ne'er to be so bound again.<lf>The day of next such entrapment shall not arrive.
<string>This cap was the favored flair of a dear friend.<lf>I hold it now very...very close to my heart.
<string>Treasures oft hide in dark, tangled thickets. But<lf>sometimes birds like you will carry them in.
<string>And so it is.
<string>I learned this tongue from a friend. The old words<lf>of the forest never pleased my palate.
<string>They serve as bonds to hold us thrall, all these<lf>eons later. Ineluctable. Slaves by instinct.
<string>Rove is a name I took myself. The word I loved<lf>best among my friend's descriptions.
<string>If one word must define me, let it be a word<lf>I hold in regard. Such was my choice.
<string>Even in this land of desolation, I oft spy those<lf>hives of hexagonal hollows...
<string>Whene'er they strike my eye, nostalgia for their<lf>golden syrup sets in. Nay, "nostalgia" is too mild.
<string>Mine tongue, mine belly flies! Flies free of this<lf>corporeal cage to seek its sweet reward.
<string>At times, I share the company of words with friends.<lf>But in the end, I return, myself, alone.
<string>Solitude is a boon. When its cold grip takes<lf>the mind, a crystal clarity begins to spread.
<string>A sensation I rather enjoy.
<string>I cannot well describe it, but being here makes me<lf>ponder my place in the world.
<string>Life and time, once lost, ne'er return.
<string>Welcome to my desolate home. This land, a resting<lf>place of that which time has left.
<string>My Wudwud's blood has led me here, I know.<lf>I do not deny that.
<string>By the by... Madam Spectacles, I could not help<lf>but note the many treasures in your possession.
<string>Their aged forms, their faded glory. The guilty<lf>pleasure of holding crumbling history in palm.
<string>What begins as one cherished token soon swells,<lf>and with it our pack. I understand well.
<string>How fares the lad? If the cold threatens to break<lf>his will, bid him to come take warmth from my fur.
<string>My word... To think even <ITALIC>that</ITALIC> proved no obstacle.
<string>Human courage truly knows no bounds.
<string>My, meetings and partings are unexpected things.<lf>...Mm? But your clear eyes carry quite a sparkle.
<string>Just like that of a hero from a troubadour's tale.<lf>Ha ha, a jest, friend. ...Surely?
<string>Have you seen that my beloved land of desolation<lf>now stands desolate of ice?
<string>That for a moment, the season of Plenty came?
<string>It seemed a gift... A boon to all that clings to life.
<string>Brr... Ne'er before today have I felt so grateful<lf>to have been born swaddled in fur.
<string>I fear before I get my fill of solitude's chill, my<lf>body will succumb to a cold more literal. Ha ha!
<string>...Not funny, that.
<string>Ahh, friend. Come to grace me with a visit?<lf>I fear I'm in ill condition to entertain...
<string>I know not why, but I feel frustration mount<lf>within me. A grinding, gnawing irritation.
<string>Mm, of late I feel in finer fettle than e'er<lf>before. I wonder what has brought this vim!
<string>...'Tis little mystery. It is, of course, your<lf>doing. I was merely being coy a moment.
<string>I thank you. Know that my gratitude<lf>is without bound.
<string>I've known e'er since our first meeting, friend.<lf>You are a wanderer. A winged soul, bound to rove.
<string>When your duty is done and you are free once more<lf>to fly, take to the skies and soar.
<string>Soar, and ne'er look back again.
<string>I've come to think, since meeting you...
<string>Days spent apart from solitude have their<lf>charms, too.
