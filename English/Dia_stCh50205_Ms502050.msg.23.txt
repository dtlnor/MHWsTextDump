<string>Ahh, how you've grown... Your skills have plainly<lf>overtaken mine. Tell me your ways, dear fisherfellow!
<string>Have you heard of Escunites? They're a shelled<lf>cephalopod found in the Scarlet Forest.
<string>What about them?
<string>Your lack of excitement wounds me, friend.
<string>Escunites are a living echo of ancient life. A<lf>rarity, even among their betentacled brethren!
<string>In short, they're weird little freaks and I love<lf>them! What's more, some bear a dazzling shimmer!
<string>Ahh... And now you want me to catch one of those.
<string>I want it badly! I long to see a radiant Escunite,<lf>but even more, I want to know how to catch one!
<string>I know that no aquatic life is beyond your grasp,<lf>fisherfellow. So away with you, and good luck!
<string>Ohhh, yes... Truly, this specimen radiates a glow<lf>unlike a common Escunite. Well caught, my friend.
<string>Now, tell me exactly how it went down in<lf>painstaking detail. Be alarmingly thorough.
<string>...No. No, wait. I retract my request.
<string>As an angler, I need to catch one for<lf>myself. However long that takes.
<string>I can respect that. Best of luck, then.
<string>Oh, it is the Escunite who'll need that luck.<lf>Just you watch, I'll land it yet!
<string>...Ah, that's right. I had an inside line on a tip<lf>sure to hook your attention, fisherfellow.
<string>There are reports of rare specimens beyond just<lf>Escunites, and unknown fish besides. Juicy, hmm?
<string>You're struggling to contain the angling urge, I can tell.<lf>Why resist? Less waiting, more baiting!
<string>Escunites are rare little guys to begin with.<lf>Catching a variant is a pretty tall order.
<string>But if anyone can, it's my fisherfellow! I'll be<lf>waiting for the good news.
<string>Hmm... I suppose your best bet is to hit places<lf>Escunites favor. Fishing holes in caverns and such.
