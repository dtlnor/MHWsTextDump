<string>Insects whose bitter extracts promote<lf>natural healing and can be combined into<lf>a variety of useful medicines and items.
<string>Windrustler
<string>Plains dwellers that move in packs. They<lf>use their arrow-like crests to coordinate<lf>movements and alert each other to threats.<lf>Since they stand their crests up when people<lf>and monsters draw near, that gesture is<lf>believed to indicate danger. Windrustlers<lf>have been sighted in Kunafa, a sign that<lf>they have learned two things: people aren't<lf>always a threat...and where there's people,<lf>there's food.
<string>A rare variant occasionally spotted in a<lf>Windrustler pack. Distinguishable by their<lf>charcoal skin and larger frame.
<string>Black Windrustler
<string>A rare variant occasionally spotted in<lf>a Windrustler pack, with charcoal skin and<lf>a larger frame.

<string>Fish with scales and fins hard enough to surpass<lf>common whetstones. The fins in particular are<lf>frequently used for sharpening.
<string>Sushifish
<string>A popular food source found in many<lf>a hunter's pouch, these fish have very<lf>high nutritional value—not just in their<lf>flesh, but their scales too. They offer<lf>a remarkable range of benefits, including<lf>health and bleeding recovery, and stamina<lf>boosts. Because of this, Sushifish are common<lf>prey for many aquatic species. They show<lf>a strong interest in Emerald Jitterbait.
<string>Fish with stunning golden scales covering<lf>their bodies. Their scales fetch high prices<lf>as accessory materials.
<string>Goldenfish
<string>With the stunning golden scales covering<lf>their bodies, it's no wonder these fish are<lf>aquarium staples and often sell for high<lf>prices for use in accessories. Goldenfish<lf>can be found in caves and other places with<lf>no sunlight and calm waters. Conversely,<lf>you will rarely see them out in the sun or<lf>in swift currents.

<string>Fish covered with platinum-colored scales.<lf>Some theorize they are related to Goldenfish<lf>due to their similar appearance and habits.
<string>Platinumfish
<string>Fish covered with platinum-colored<lf>scales. Like the Goldenfish, they are<lf>a popular feature in aquariums and<lf>accessories—but at higher prices,<lf>because of their relative scarcity. The<lf>leading theory for the Platinumfish's<lf>unique coloring is that they adapted<lf>to their sunless cave environments.<lf>They show a strong interest in Golden<lf>Bugheads.
<string>Fish with head plating to defend against<lf>threats. The roe in their abdomens is safe<lf>for consumption and highly nutritious.
<string>Gravid Bowfin
<string>Fish with head plating to defend against<lf>threats. The plating is not part of their<lf>biology but rather a collection of scavenged<lf>materials. Because of the similar fin<lf>shapes, some believe these are actually<lf>female Virid Bowfins in their breeding<lf>period. However, not enough specimens<lf>have been found or studied to shed light<lf>on these theories. Gravid Bowfins show<lf>a strong interest in Emerald Jitterbait.
