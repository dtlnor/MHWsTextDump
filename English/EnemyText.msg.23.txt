However, until more specimens<lf>are collected and research conducted,<lf>it will remain as speculation. Grand Escunites<lf>show a strong interest in Tentacle Jigs.

<string>Great Trevally
<string>
<string>
<string>Large fish notable for their sizeable mouths,<lf>which can gobble down most small- to medium-<lf>sized prey in one go. Great Trevally are<lf>diurnal and have a wide range of habitats.<lf>Smaller specimens can even be found in the<lf>shallows. They show a strong interest in<lf>Tuff Joint Bait.

<string>Gravid Bowfin
<string>
<string>
<string>Fish with head plating to defend against<lf>threats. The plating is not part of their<lf>biology but rather a collection of scavenged<lf>materials. Because of the similar fin<lf>shapes, some believe these are actually<lf>female Virid Bowfins in their breeding<lf>period. However, not enough specimens<lf>have been found or studied to shed light<lf>on these theories. Gravid Bowfins show<lf>a strong interest in Emerald Jitterbait.

<string>
<string>Fish that have adapted to waters where<lf>Wyvern Milk flows. Their eyes have<lf>degenerated, presumably to reduce energy<lf>consumption. In lieu of sight, Blind Perch<lf>have developed organs on the sides of their<lf>bodies to sense tremors in the water and<lf>gain awareness of their surroundings.<lf>What they use for nourishment still<lf>remains unknown.
