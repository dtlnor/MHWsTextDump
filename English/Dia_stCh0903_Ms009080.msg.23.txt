<string>Strange... What are all of the Wudwuds doing<lf>there? Has something happened?
<string>Have talking for you! Forest lord, big trouble.
<string>What's happened?
<string>Let's talk about it later.
<string>I talking. You listen.
<string>Why? Preparings? Hurry-quick!
<string>What? The forest has filled with water? I suppose<lf>the Downpour has continued for some time...

<string>Lord of forest, different. Big angry! More water<lf>go WHOOSH!

<string><COLOR FF0000>#Rejected#</COLOR> Dia_stCh0903_Ms009080_0030_t005
<string>You mean Uth Duna? But since when have its<lf>rampages ever flooded the whole forest?
<string>If it was exposed to a Downpour for this long...<lf>The impact could be enormous.
<string>That's true. At some point, the nonstop rains will<lf>fill the dam upstream to its limits.
<string>And if an agitated Uth Duna were to run amok in those<lf>circumstances, the whole structure could collapse.

<string>Forest, danger. Big, BIG water. You all run.
<string>Lord of forest, same as forest itself. Leave to<lf>Wudwuds! This time, Wudwuds help you.
<string>They're going to try to stop<lf>Uth Duna themselves?
<string>We appreciate the offer, but it's too dangerous.
<string>You're willing to help us. We want to help you.<lf>How about we cooperate, as a team?
<string>Copper...ate? Tim?
<string>Right. You—the Wudwuds—the Hunter, and myself,<lf>all working together. That's a team.
<string>And this forest is our team's home. If it's in danger,<lf>we work together.
<string>Tim, copper-ate! Good! Big together!
<string>Close enough.
<string>Fur going pricka-prick. This feeling... Lord of<lf>forest, close!
<string>Remember, it's been exposed to sustained<lf>anomalous weather. Let's be careful.
<string>Lord, big strong. Tim, use this!
<string>How very generous. Thank you.
<string>I can see what she meant. Letting that roam free<lf>with the weather like this is far too dangerous.
<string>Agreed. As an emergency countermeasure,<lf>the Guild authorizes you to hunt the Uth Duna!
<string>BIG please!
<string>Understood!
<string>Wudwuds gathered trappings! Tim use!
<string>Tim, hungerful? Must be hungerful!
<string>Here. You eat! Lord BIG strong. This make tim<lf>strong too!
<string>When you're ready, accept the quest<lf>to continue the investigation.
<string>Angry lord of forest, quiet now... Thankings!<lf>Big thank!
<string>Of course. Although we couldn't have<lf>done it without your help.
<string>Tim, work together! Come with, hurry-quick!
<string>Then you have quelled the lord's ragings? Many<lf>thanks. The forest is now free of this menace.
<string>Only because you all warned<lf>us of the danger so quickly.
<string>The Wudwuds also played a big role in this.
<string>Wudwuds and hunter, copper-ate! Tim!
<string>Well said. We're so glad to be on the same<lf>tim—team!
<string>Though, in the meantime, this continued rain must<lf>make things difficult for you. Are you concerned?
<string>Worry not. As long as the lord of the forest is<lf>appeased, the troubles we face are smallish.
<string>On topic of smallishness, your puny hovel is in<lf>big dangers. Go and worry on that.
<string>Th-Thank you. Your concern is much appreciated.
<string>Right. Let's tell Base Camp to stay on watch.
<string>And after that, back to our investigation.<lf>This weather sure isn't letting up...
<string>Good lucky, tim!
<string>...Ahh. Now tribooty safe and sound.
