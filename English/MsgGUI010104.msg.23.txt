<string>While surveying the Forbidden Lands, Alma spots an unconscious boy who<lf>carries a mysterious pendant and murmurs in an ancient tongue.
<string>Tasked with exploring the Forbidden Lands, the Hunter heads east on the<lf>sandship and comes across a girl fleeing from a large pack of monsters.
<string>Once the girl is saved, she tells the Hunter that her brother remains in<lf>peril, having drawn the monsters' attention away from her.
<string>The Seikret brings the Hunter to a large cavern where a man is being<lf>attacked by a Chatacabra.
<string>The Hunter rescues the man and brings him back to the newly constructed<lf>Base Camp.
<string>A hungry Quematrice blocks the Support Team's way back to Base Camp.
<string>Y'sai invites the Hunter's group to Kunafa, a bustling little village where<lf>the people live among the gemchimes.
<string>The group is treated to a feast at Y'sai's house.
<string>The Hunter and company venture into the forest to survey the Doshaguma.
<string>Erik goes missing in the midst of the investigation, and the group finds him<lf>unconscious in the nest of a Lala Barina.
<string>The Hunter goes to their Pop-up Camp only to find it being ransacked<lf>by Lynians.
<string>The group sets out to hunt the Congalala at the behest of the Wudwuds,<lf>only for them to wake it up.
<string>This time, the Hunter returns to camp to find it being torn apart by a pack<lf>of Doshaguma, with a particularly large one among them.
<string>The Hunter races across the desert and discovers a wounded Zatoh<lf>struggling against a pack of Balahara.
<string>Just as the Hunter predicted, the Doshaguma formed a pack and attacked<lf>Kunafa. The time has come for the Hunter to prove their worth.
<string>After driving the other Doshaguma into quicksand, the Hunter faces off<lf>against their leader.
<string>With the Doshaguma gone, the desert enters a season of Plenty. Grateful for<lf>the Hunter's assistance, the Elder offers her aid in return.
<string>As Olivia and Erik continue to search for the White Wraith, they're met<lf>with a sudden torrent of rain and a mysterious leviathan.
<string>Avis Unit and Astrum Unit work together to drive off the leviathan, when<lf>suddenly they hear a loud roar. They rush in the direction of the sound,<lf>only to find...
<string>Avis Unit rendezvous with Zatoh, who says he's going to a village among the<lf>oilsprings for trade.
<string>The Hunter and company arrive in Azuz, the Everforge, a village dedicated<lf>to craftsmanship.
<string>The Hunter makes for the Oilwell Basin to find an Oilfolk girl named Maki,<lf>when they're suddenly attacked by a Rompopolo.
<string>After rescuing Maki and bringing her back to Azuz, preparations for the<lf>Firespring Festival begin. The people's excitement can hardly be contained,<lf>until something goes awry with the Everforge.
<string>A messenger from Kunafa finds Zatoh and tells him that an unexpected<lf>sandstorm is approaching the village.
<string>The Hunter and company rush to Wind's Gasp and discover the region's<lf>apex predator there, along with the White Wraith.
<string>After overcoming the apex predator and returning to camp, the group<lf>witnesses a strange light coming from the Landspine.
<string>The people of Azuz lead Avis Unit to an underground tunnel that Nata<lf>recognizes.
<string>While searching for a path to the surface, Avis Unit finds a Wudwud captured<lf>by a Nerscylla.
<string>The Hunter and company realize that the cliffs they ascend are actually one<lf>vast, ancient structure. Their wonderment is interrupted by a pack of<lf>Hirabami.
<string>Just as Avis Unit decides to head back to Azuz, they realize that Nata's<lf>come down with a fever.
<string>Perhaps because of the recent repairs to the Landspine, a sudden Firespring<lf>hits the basin. But then the Everforge unexpectedly erupts...
<string>One after another, Ajarakan invade the village. Then all at once, something<lf>akin to a strange dark flame rises from the depths of the basin.
<string>The Firespring Festival is finally held, producing glittering chunks of<lf>Oricalcite. Nata realizes just how resilient people can be.
<string>Avis Unit runs into an abnormal, white Doshaguma near the ruins of<lf>the Keepers' village.
<string>Tasheen and Nata's tearful reunion is suddenly interrupted by a peculiar<lf>white Rathalos.
<string>In the Keepers' village, people rely on a wellspring of limitless energy to<lf>survive. Tasheen proceeds to explain this land's history to Avis Unit.
<string>It is revealed the Guardians are creatures of human construction. As Nata<lf>struggles to accept this revelation, Arkveld appears out of nowhere.
<string>Avis Unit resolves to see the Allhearken to learn why the Guardian Arkveld<lf>has begun to engage in predation.
<string>As the Hunter and company race along a precarious path to visit the<lf>Allhearken, they are waylaid by a giant lord of ice.
<string>After a difficult battle, the Hunter and company manage to ward off the lord<lf>of ice and finally arrive in Suja, where the Allhearken lives.
<string>After finding the Allhearken, she speaks of the ancient history of Wyveria.
<string>As the Hunter and company set out to learn more about the Guardians,<lf>they're attacked by a Guardian Ebony Odogaron.
<string>The Hunter is taken by surprise and dragged into a monster's lair, where<lf>they find an unknown monster feasting on Guardians.
<string>Avis Unit follows Arkveld into the lower stratum and discovers<lf>it overfeeding on prey.
<string>After paying their respects to Arkveld, Avis Unit makes for the Dragontorch<lf>in the depths of Wyveria, but what they see there astonishes them.
<string>Zoh Shia, who feeds on the energy of the Dragontorch, will soon wake.<lf>But what is the best course of action?
<string>Nata decides to put a stop to the Dragontorch, determined to fulfill his<lf>duty, but the Hunter offers him a different solution.
<string>The Hunter and company return to Suja, having carried out their duty.<lf>People and nature stand ready to welcome them with open arms.

<string>Some time after slaying Zoh Shia, the Hunter and Alma have something<lf>to show Nata.
<string>The Hunter and company visit the Ruins of Wyveria, where they witness<lf>a Lala Barina in a desperate struggle for survival.
<string>While the Hunter and company are searching for Gore Magala in the<lf>Iceshard Cliffs, they come across Frenzied monsters.
<string>Harboring some suspicions, the Hunter's group heads for Wind's Gasp.<lf>There, they see an Arkveld that resembles its origin species.
<string>A pack of Yian Kut-ku have taken up residence in the forest, much to the<lf>chagrin of Sassafrill.
<string>While returning to Base Camp from Kunafa, the Hunter and company see<lf>an unfamiliar fanged beast.
<string>The Hunter quickly saves the young girl and her bird wyvern from being<lf>pulled into the quicksand.
<string>The Hunter and Zatoh fall into quicksand and find themselves in an<lf>underground cavern where they're attacked by a Balahara.
<string>With Tasheen's help, Avis Unit opens up a path to Wyveria's middle stratum.<lf>They set out to learn more about the Guardians.
<string>A great lord of ice blocks the way of those who would dare enter<lf>the Rimechain Peak.
<string>The hunter, Alma, and Kanya venture deep into the Forest to warn<lf>Mastangler of impending danger, but it seems that danger has<lf>already found him.
<string>The faint whispers that reached the Allhearken come from a single,<lf>stirring voice, nurtured by the light of the Dragontorch.
<string>The group receives a dinner invitation from the Allhearken.
