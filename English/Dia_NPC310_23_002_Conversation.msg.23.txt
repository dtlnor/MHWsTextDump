<string>Heh heh heh... It'll take more than a little heat<lf>wave to make this kitty wilt.
<string>Azuz is the perfect fit for me. I can feel it.
<string>Another day of giving the Support Team all<lf>I've got.
<string>What's with this vibe...?<lf>I want to bust out dancing!
<string>Aah, my heart's soaring, paws tapping,<lf>whiskers trembling!
<string>Inside or out, it is H-O-T <ITALIC>hot!</ITALIC>
<string>I'm the one leading up the Support Team for<lf>this Base Camp. Pleasure.
<string>I'm not about to play hooky, but I do hope I get<lf>a little time to wander about.
<string>Be careful out there, Hunter! I reckon the<lf>desert's smack in the middle of a sandstorm!
<string>If we can't stop the heat, we burn out bright!
<string>Yeah, I think I'm a fan of the Firespring Festival.
<string>I'd love the chance to talk to Fabius just once.
<string>The festival... Is it time for the festival yet?<lf>I've become a total Firespring fiend here!
<string>Times like these, you crank the fire in your heart<lf>to full blast!
<string>I'm gonna do my dang job!
<string>OK, this HAS to be burning too hot, right!?
<string>Boy, that Black Flame was something...
<string>Even the hottest soup's fine, soon as it's down<lf>the hatch.
<string>We'll probably only get to live here a short while,<lf>but I hope we stick around in these folks' hearts.
<string>Salutations, Hunter. Let's make today's<lf>investigation a spicy one.
