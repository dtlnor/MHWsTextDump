<string>I'd like to use the melding pot.
<string>How have things been lately?
<string>Are you offering anything new?
<string>(End Conversation)
<string>Goodness me. I wondered what sort of little bird<lf>would flit in—but a human? Quite unexpected.
<string>Well, whatever you may be, take these materials<lf>with you. The Allhearken bade me ready it for you.
<string>We use them in our melding pot. I'm happy to do so<lf>with any materials of yours, too.
<string>Quite the unusual bauble you're carrying, there.<lf>A relic of an age long past.
<string>Stewing its kind in the melding pot will change<lf>their characteristics.
<string>If you find no use for the one you have there,<lf>perhaps giving it a good soak here would be wise.
<string>Ah, yes. As I've played with adding this and that,<lf>I've found a way to arrive at specific decorations.
<string>Endlessly fascinating, the art of melding... Why<lf>not give it a try yourself?
<string>Oho? That's quite the peculiar talisman<lf>you're carrying.
<string>Dunking such talismans in the melding pot<lf>will change their characteristics.
<string>If you find no use for the one you have there,<lf>perhaps giving it a good soak here would be wise.
<string>Yes. In my experiments, I've come across a way to<lf>meld new feystones.
<string>Care to give it a try? Today may just be your<lf>lucky day.
<string>Yes, yes. A recent experiment opened the way for<lf>melding new sorts of things.
<string>Care to try it now? Treasure may be waiting just<lf>moments away.
<string>Oh, yes. As I've continued my tinkering, I've<lf>found recipes for new weapon fragments.
<string>Shall we try it? It could lead to the<lf>birth of a masterwork.
<string>Yes, I'm now able to specify the type of Artian<lf>material created from weapon fragments.
<string>I do hope it's useful, dear.
<string>Come take a look.
<string>Don't be a stranger.
<string>Take care now.
<string>Give it a try.
<string>Are you looking for something?
<string>There you are.
<string>I hope it suits your tastes.
