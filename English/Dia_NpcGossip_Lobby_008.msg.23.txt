<string>The Terra Unit are so picky about what they eat.
<string>Right? They should take tips from us.<lf>As long as meat's involved, we're set!
<string>You can't just eat meat, either...<lf>You need vegetables, too.
<string>Apparently our handler saw the roof<lf>of the Wudwud hideout go up in flames.
<string>Maybe they were just grilling some meat?<lf>Now I wanna go see...
<string>I'm telling you, you need a more balanced diet.<lf>At least try fish or something.
<string>Those Support Desk Felynes are amazing.
<string>I can't agree more. They offer items, ingredients,<lf>news, help for setting up Pop-up Camps... The works.
<string>Have you heard about Monster Chilis? You can get them every now<lf>and then when picking Wyvernsprouts from a monster carcass.
<string>One bite of that stuff and you'll feel like<lf>you can handle any kind of environment.
<string>You Terra Unit guys sure know your food.
<string>I like changing the Flysheet color to match<lf>the area where I've set up my Pop-up Camp.
<string>Oh, and you can't forget camp<lf>chairs. Gotta have those.
<string>You Terra Unit guys sure are picky about<lf>those sorts of things, huh?
<string>This flower is such a beautiful color.
<string>Yeah... It'll go towards keeping our hunters safe.
<string>Yup, that's our job!
<string>Looking at flowers is making<lf>me crave something sweet.
<string>How about some dango? Oh, and some tea!
<string>I heard there's a song about this<lf>flower in the land of Shiki.
<string>Have you ever been there?
<string>Nah, not even once.
<string>Those carved wooden statues sure are...unique.<lf>Who made those?
<string>I'm not sure. Probably Crow.
<string>Everyone in Aurora Unit is kind of weird,<lf>so that makes sense...
<string>Have you tried the seasonal meal yet? The meat was to<lf>die for! So savory...
<string>What are you saying!? ALL meat is to die for!
<string>I should have seen that coming. Did you even eat the<lf>fruit that came with it?
<string>Those Wudwuds are really into shiny objects, huh?
<string>One of them is, that's for sure. I think he's at their<lf>hideout in the Scarlet Forest.
<string>That giant candelabra kind of looks like<lf>a cage, doesn't it?
<string>I can't help wondering if it could<lf>be used for something.
<string>I guess I can't blame you for going there,<lf>considering your area of expertise.
<string>The menu this time around is pretty amazing,<lf>isn't it? It's like food for the soul.
<string>It's literally the only thing my unit<lf>has been ordering lately.
<string>Maybe order some veggies too, yeah?
<string>Did you know the tea they serve here<lf>changes color? I love it.
<string>But Kai took one look and now<lf>he refuses to even try it.
<string>He sure is picky, that one.
<string>This is a nice treat for the eyes.
<string>We have a lot more work ahead of us...
<string>Yeah. The hunters are counting on us<lf>to keep them alive.
<string>I prefer my pie crusts flaky, not moist, so in<lf>that regard this meal is just about perfect.
<string>That's not to say I don't like moist pies! I just<lf>want to be vocal with my feedback so that next time—
<string>You other units sure are passionate about food.
<string>This is all so breathtaking...<lf>I think I'm starting to tear up.
<string>I was just thinking. Can you imagine if<lf>the Wudwuds were here?
<string>Oh no! It'd be carnage! They'd raze the place<lf>just to get their hands on all the sparklies.
