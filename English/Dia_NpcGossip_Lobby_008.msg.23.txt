<string>The Terra Unit are so picky about what they eat.
<string>Right? They should take tips from us.<lf>As long as meat's involved, we're set!
<string>You can't just eat meat, either...<lf>You need vegetables, too.
<string>Apparently our handler saw the roof<lf>of the Wudwud hideout go up in flames.
<string>Maybe they were just grilling some meat?<lf>Now I wanna go see...
<string>I'm telling you, you need a more balanced diet.<lf>At least try fish or something.
<string>Those Support Desk Felynes are amazing.
<string>I can't agree more. They offer items, ingredients,<lf>news, help for setting up Pop-up Camps... The works.
<string>Have you heard about Monster Chilis? You can get them every now<lf>and then when picking Wyvernsprouts from a monster carcass.
<string>One bite of that stuff and you'll feel like<lf>you can handle any kind of environment.
<string>You Terra Unit guys sure know your food.
<string>I like changing the Flysheet color to match<lf>the area where I've set up my Pop-up Camp.
<string>Oh, and you can't forget camp<lf>chairs. Gotta have those.
<string>You Terra Unit guys sure are picky about<lf>those sorts of things, huh?

<string>This flower is such a beautiful color.
<string>Yeah... It'll go towards keeping our hunters safe.
<string>Yup, that's our job!
<string>Looking at flowers is making<lf>me crave something sweet.
<string>How about some dango? Oh, and some tea!
<string>I heard there's a song about this<lf>flower in the land of Shiki.
<string>Have you ever been there?
<string>Nah, not even once.

<string>Those carved wooden statues sure are...unique.<lf>Who made those?
<string>I'm not sure. Probably Crow.
<string>Everyone in Aurora Unit is kind of weird,<lf>so that makes sense...
<string>Have you tried the seasonal meal yet? The meat was to<lf>die for! So savory...
<string>What are you saying!? ALL meat is to die for!
<string>I should have seen that coming. Did you even eat the<lf>fruit that came with it?
<string>Those Wudwuds are really into shiny objects, huh?
<string>One of them is, that's for sure. I think he's at their<lf>hideout in the Scarlet Forest.
