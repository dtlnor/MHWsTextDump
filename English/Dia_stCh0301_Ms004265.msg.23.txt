<string>There you are. I wish to discuss our next move.<lf>Do you have a moment?
<string>Sure. Let's talk.
<string>I need to take care of other things.
<string>This way.
<string>I see... Well, I'll be here.
<string>You know, if there's anything I learned from<lf>my time in Azuz, it's this...
<string>What did you learn in Azuz?
<string>(Open the Quest Board)
<string>(End Conversation)
<string>I asked the people, "Why do you keep it up?<lf>Crafting the same old things the same old way?"
<string>They all looked at me and said,<lf>"Why? WHY? 'Cuz we likes to, that's why! Bwahahaha!"
<string>Turns out, that's a pretty universal reason.<lf>Why study things? Why hunt? "'Cuz we likes to!"
<string>Is that what they sound like...?
<string>Anyway, it occurred to me that I might've been<lf>too fixated on our differences.
<string>But we're all made of the same stuff.<lf>People are people, wherever you go.
<string>I'm glad I got to spend time with the ones in Azuz.
<string>Hey, congrats on another job well done.<lf>The heat was on, but you were blazing!
<string>Right back at you.
<string>(Use the Facility)
<string>(End Conversation)
<string>Right back at you.
<string>Everyone—you, the rest of the team,<lf>the villagers. It was amazing!
<string>And Maki's whole outlook's really turned around.<lf>All that fire really put a shine on her.
<string>And that little girl that used<lf>to be a lot like her... Does she approve?
<string>Oh, yikes. Are we really going there?
<string>I guess...little Gemma would be ugly-crying<lf>her eyes out. That's how proud she'd be.
<string>Thanks, Hunter. You're a good friend.
<string>You know, I might just hang on to you.
<string>Hunter! Wasn't the Firespring Festival incredible?
<string>It sure was. Did you have fun?
<string>I had SO much fun!
<string>I'm really happy I was able to see this place.
<string>The people are so full of life, and creative, and...<lf>and shouty! They go after things with all they've got.
<string>Where I come from, people aren't quite like that.
<string>I just wanted to say thank you...<lf>for making this journey with me.
<string>I know I haven't been much help yet, but I'll<lf>do my best to guide us to my village.
<string>Ho there. That festival was a spectacle we won't<lf>soon forget, huh? The sparkle on that Oricalcite!
<string>Thanks for defending Azuz while I was gone.<lf>It freed me up to focus on the hunt.
<string>Of course. Keeping people safe is what I live for.<lf>It's my guiding "astrum," you might say.
<string>I'm just glad we kept everyone safe.<lf>Not a single life was lost...
<string>Nothing matters more to me than that.
<string>So, uhhh...yeah.
<string>Guess I made trouble for you back there.
<string>That's not the problem.
<string>Sorry, I missed that...
<string>If the trouble's just for me, I can handle it.<lf>But that's not the problem...
<string>Look, I know what you're going to say.
<string>Thing is, my brain doesn't work like other people's.<lf>I still don't think what I did was wrong!
<string>Sometimes, you're just going to have to spell it out<lf>for me. And that's fine. I can take it, you hear?
<string>What's that? I think my ears are still ringing from<lf>all the monster roars. Could you say that again?
<string>Seriously!? Fine, fine!<lf><ITALIC>I</ITALIC> caused <ITALIC>everyone</ITALIC> a lot of trouble!
<string>If the trouble's just for me, I can handle it.<lf>But that's not the problem...
<string>Look, I know what you're going to say.
<string>Thing is, my brain doesn't work like other people's.<lf>I still don't think what I did was wrong!
<string>Sometimes, you're just going to have to spell it<lf>out for me. And that's fine. I can take it, you hear?
<string>Sorry about Werner. Thanks for cleaning up his mess.
<string>That must have been a real handwringer for Olivia.
<string>Honestly, it's a mystery to me how<lf>the two of them even get along.
<string>Are you kidding me? Those two are so much alike!
<string>If anything, it feels like I'm the one<lf>struggling to keep up with them.
<string>If it wasn't for Olivia and Werner,<lf>I probably wouldn't even be in the Guild.
<string>Which I guess I shouldn't say too loudly, or they'll leave<lf>me in the bushes somewhere.
