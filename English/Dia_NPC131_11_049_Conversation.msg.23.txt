<string>My mom is making me run errands for her,<lf>but it's sooo boring.
<string>I mean, I'll do it. But I just want to go<lf>Seikret riding already!
<string>Ooh, ooh! You know what I could<lf>REALLY eat right now?
<string>Cheese, with honey poured on top. It's sooo good.
<string>I can run really fast. I'm the fastest of all<lf>my friends!
<string>...If you don't count Nona.
<string>I can never catch Nona when we're playing tag.<lf>Oh, but I can eat more than she can!
<string>The Sandtide's coming! Everybody hide!
<string>Plen-ty! Plen-ty!
<string>I wanna go fetch water with the others, but they<lf>told me I shouldn't go outside the village...
<string>But as soon as there are no grown-ups around to<lf>yell at us, we're going. That's a secret, though!
<string>Everybody's all happy and relaxed now that the<lf>Plenty's here. Well, everyone 'cept Zatoh.
<string>He's all...staring off into the distance-y. Just like<lf>always. He's so cool!
<string>I want to ride my Seikret, drink some fresh<lf>water, play in the water...
<string>Ugggh, they should at least let us go play when<lf>the Plenty comes!
<string>Huh? Are you and the other people in the weird<lf>clothes leaving? Already?
<string>If you're looking for Zatoh, he's guarding the<lf>water bearers.
<string>He's always watching out for us. If you shout his<lf>name, he'll come running to help.
<string>Thank you, traveler! All I could think about was<lf>just getting away...
<string>But I wish I could have seen what you did.<lf>It must have been so cool!
<string>You're really awesome!
<string>Everyone was freaking out, even the Elder!
<string>I'm really happy Zatoh's back. I always feel safe<lf>when he's here.
<string>Grown-ups are always telling me not to go too far<lf>off because it's <ITALIC>dangerous</ITALIC>... I can handle it!
<string>When I'm on a Seikret, I can ride faster than<lf>the wind! Honest!
<string>I just need to practice not falling<lf>off a little bit more.
<string>I'm real busy lately. I'm training to be the best<lf>Seikret rider ever!
<string>Just like Zatoh!
<string>Hey, traveler! I heard you went somewhere really<lf>far away!
<string>They say you fought all these giant monsters! That<lf>sounds a little scary, but that's sooo cool!
<string>Guess what! Zatoh taught me the trick to becoming<lf>a member of the Vanguard!
<string>After I learn to ride a Seikret good, the next<lf>thing is to learn about all the villagers' jobs.
<string>Because we have to protect them, you know?<lf>Just watch, I'm gonna protect the village, too!
<string>Someday I'll beat Nona! I'll show her!
<string>Argh, why is she so fast? And her Seikret always<lf>listens to what she tells it...
