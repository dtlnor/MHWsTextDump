<string>My mom is making me run errands for her,<lf>but it's sooo boring.
<string>I mean I'll do it. But I just want to go Seikret<lf>riding already!
<string>Ooh, ooh! You know what I could REALLY eat<lf>right now?
<string>Cheese, with honey poured on top. It's sooo good.
<string>I can run really fast. I'm the fastest of all<lf>my friends!
<string>...If you don't count Nona.
<string>I can never catch Nona when we're playing tag.<lf>Oh, but I can eat more than she can!
<string>The Sandtide's coming! Everybody hide!
<string>Plen-ty! Plen-ty!
<string>I wanna go fetch water with the others, but they<lf>told me I shouldn't go outside the village...
<string>But as soon as there are no grownups around to<lf>yell at us, we're going. That's a secret, though!
<string>Everybody's all happy and relaxed now that the<lf>Plenty's here. Well, everyone 'cept Zatoh.
<string>He's all...staring off to the distance-like. Just like<lf>always. He's so cool!
<string>I want to ride my Seikret, drink some fresh<lf>water, play in the water...
<string>Ugggh, they should at least let us go play when<lf>the Plenty comes!
