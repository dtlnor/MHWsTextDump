<string>So that's the trick!
<string>Nata, that pendant is a memento from your father.
<string>What do you want to do?
<string>I...don't know...
<string>Unleash its power...and this land will be wiped out.
<string>The Keepers know the Torch and Guardians<lf>better than anyone.
<string>Advice would be welcome.
<string>Us!?
<string>Our forefathers knew little... As for us,<lf>we know as much as you.
<string>Simple observers have no right to<lf>decide the fate of the world.
<string>Even so...
<string>Someone has to.
<string>My vote is to save as many lives as possible.
<string>We must stop the Dragontorch.
<string>Whoa, hold on! AFTER we investigate!
<string>We don't have all the information!
<string>You're idiots to throw it away. The world will<lf>never see such innovation again.
<string>Says the man who has seen what these menaces are capable of.
<string>Or shall we wait for the worst?
<string>Then let me study it—see how it works.<lf>Then do what you want. Easy.
<string>Easy's no word to just throw around.<lf>This will destroy their natural order!
<string>Their society will be completely uprooted!
<string>But at least they won't be dead.
<string>That...may be true.<lf>But the comparison's not that simple.
<string>Seriously! Like, what right do we even have!?
<string>We can't just march in as outsiders and decide.
<string>Right... But we're running out of time.
<string>The lives involved take priority.
<string>It'll be my sword to fall on, and I will.
<string>I can take the pendant and—
<string>I'll do it.
<string>I'll...I'll stop the Dragontorch.
<string>Nata...
<string>It's what my father would have wanted.
<string>This is my role.
<string>I admire your resolve.
<string>Are you sure?
<string>Olivia. Let us take it from here.
<string>We'll go with him.
<string>You're OK with that?
<string>Call on me if I'm needed.
<string>I'll be ready.
<string>Nata!
<string>Tasheen, wait here for me?
<string>My boy...
<string>I'll be OK.
<string>I'm a Keeper, too.
