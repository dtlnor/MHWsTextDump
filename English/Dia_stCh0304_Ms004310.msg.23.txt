<string>The place I'm taking you is known to<lf>the Keepers as the "Resting Place."
<string>Before we go, I need to tell you about<lf>the monster that attacked the village...
<string>It is a Guardian by the name of Arkveld.
<string>Arkveld! I knew it was an extinct species.
<string>But...what exactly is a Guardian?
<string>It's the name we have used since the Age<lf>of Wyveria for monsters that serve people.
<string>Huh? What do you mean, "serve"?
<string>It is the secret we've kept these many years.<lf>Now then, follow me.

<string>There's no way there are monsters that will<lf>just follow people's orders...right?

<string>Soon enough, you will see for yourselves—<lf>just what the Guardians are.
<string>Our destination is just ahead.<lf>Follow me.
<string>The White Wraith—Guardian Arkveld!<lf>We have to drive it off!
<string>Nata and Tasheen are off hiding someplace. By the<lf>time I noticed, they were gone.
<string>So don't worry. We do this the same as always.<lf>Get good and ready, and watch Arkveld close.
<string>The devolved gut and gullet, the lack of reproductive<lf>organs... It's because they were man-made?
<string>I need a while to organize my thoughts.<lf>I've...got a lot to process.
<string>I thought these Guardians or whatever<lf>didn't eat, though?
<string>But Arkveld was eating—<ITALIC>predating.</ITALIC> Right? So, which<lf>is it? What gives?
<string>Please, drive back Arkveld and secure Nata and<lf>Tasheen's safety.
<string>And above all, please, <ITALIC>please</ITALIC> be careful!
<string>There were more cocoons back there as well.
<string>Just how many of those Guardians are slumbering<lf>in Wyveria now?
<string>A Guardian with no need to eat engaged in predation.<lf>...I doubt it's simple whim or coincidence.
<string>Every phenomenon has its cause... Am I wrong?
<string>Keep an eye on its chain-like appendages. Learning<lf>their attacks and reach will be vital!
<string>Right after it swings one of those chains<lf>is your chance to attack!
<string>Try focusing and targeting its weak points.
<string>Everyone, I'm told the Allhearken lives in<lf>a village in the peaks called Suja.
<string>However, the only path there from the Iceshard Cliffs<lf>is frozen over and supposedly untraversable.
<string>We'll need to set up a Base Camp somewhere<lf>and search for a different route.
<string>Well, we're in luck then. Astrum Unit got in touch,
<string>and it sounds like they've built a Base Camp<lf>in that secret place Rove showed us.
<string>Then what do you say we link up with them<lf>and share everything we've learned?
<string>I wonder how deep this goes...
<string>I'm almost afraid to find out.
<string>"Monsters that serve people"...
