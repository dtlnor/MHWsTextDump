<string>Nice. Keep this up, and we'll show them what's what<lf>at the next one.
<string>Out of all the tribes, nobody's tougher than Stone.<lf>Gah hah hah!
<string>Eyy, you good? As for us... Well, have a look!<lf>Gah hah hah!
<string>...Gorgeous. That sight never gets old.
<string>We can all bust our rears because we know the<lf>festival's coming. It's what we live for.
<string>The work you put in every day, that's what makes<lf>a good festival. Look forward to the next one!
<string>What, we got visitors?<lf>Welcome to the Stonefolk, friends!
<string>Everybody here's got a real fire in their belly.<lf>Buncha lovable meathead types. Gah hah hah!
<string>There's no spectacle quite like an Azuz festival.<lf>You do <ITALIC>not</ITALIC> wanna miss it.
<string>Well, it might be a little less impressive if those<lf>Oil guys don't get it together. That's up to them.
<string>The festival, refusing to start...? Never heard<lf>of anything like it before.
<string>Ehh, I'm sure it's just a little late. A bit of<lf>waiting just gets you more fired up, yeah?
<string>I know I said waiting gets you more fired up, but<lf>I wasn't looking for this kinda heat!
<string>The festival's what keeps this village going. Who<lf>knows what would've happened if you weren't here.
<string>I'm grateful, friend. You're Azuz's savior.
<string>A whole lot's happened, but it's been a lot easier<lf>to mingle with the other tribes.
<string>Aw, this again? Guess the Firespring's as thrown<lf>off as we are, lately.
<string>We're able to manage this never-ending Firespring<lf>for now, thanks to the bosses coordinating.
<string>But, uh... These things have their limits.
<string>Out of the furnace and into the forge... I bet the<lf>bosses are at their wits' end.
<string>I'll be honest. There's not a damn thing we can do<lf>about monsters.
<string>That said... If we want to keep living here, we'll<lf>probably have to figure out how to change that.
<string>Our savior returns! Another chapter to add<lf>to your legend, eh?
<string>The bosses are fired up hotter than I've ever<lf>seen 'em.
<string>I feel like getting to know the other tribes has<lf>only turned up the heat on our competition.
<string>Gotta love a worthy opponent. We'll show 'em what<lf>the Stonefolk can do!
<string>Hey, friend! Keeping busy? We're as fired up as<lf>ever, here... No, hotter than ever!
