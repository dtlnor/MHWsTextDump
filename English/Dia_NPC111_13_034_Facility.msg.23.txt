<string>I've got you pegged as another stone-lover.<lf>Heh, no need to try and hide it!
<string>I see you out there, swinging that pick day in and<lf>day out! That makes us family.
<string>And with all we owe you for? I'm sending you off<lf>with my best finds, whether you like it or not!
<string>So, here's the deal: when you're ready to receive<lf>some rock, you come to me and talk.
<string>Hey, I got what you wanted.
<string>Alright, leave it to me.
