<string>How's the investigation going?
<string>Things just keep on happening since getting here,<lf>eh? You'll have to catch me up sometime.
<string>It ain't easy hauling freight here from the West.<lf>Not knowing the lay of the land ain't great either.
<string>What's wrong? There's no need for worries,<lf>not when we're fully stocked!
<string>When I first got here, I was shocked by how the<lf>air smelled. Just smells like air now, though.
<string>I guess the good news is that when I go back,<lf>I'll really be able to smell that hometown air again.
<string>...Ahh, I miss that smell.
<string>...Man, when the wind picks up, the sand really<lf>gets in your eyes. Gotta be careful not to rub it in.
<string>I'm never sure what to do for supply load this<lf>time of year.
<string>Ah, you must be the one I've been hearing about.<lf>The Avis Unit Hunter.
<string>I just got posted here as extra support.<lf>Good to meet you.
<string>I've got a bit of a history with Fabius. Nothing<lf>big, just worked with him in another region.
<string>I remember the Guild pouring a lot of resources<lf>into that mission. Guess it was a big one.
<string>This one seems to be turning out the same.
<string>The wind changes with the region. Especially here.<lf>It's nothing like back west.
<string>Deckhands tend to be sensitive to the wind.<lf>It's either your best friend or your worst enemy.
<string>The wind sure is blowing today.
<string>Gore Magala... Haven't heard that name in a while.
<string>Now that I think of it, I've heard that Fabius<lf>also has tales involving the Gore Magala.
<string>It was quite a while back, though.
<string>Hearing about your exploits is like reading some<lf>sort of adventure novel.
<string>This place has its charms, but I'm starting to<lf>miss things back west.
<string>I took this job because I love to travel, but...<lf>Guess I love home a little more.
<string>Guess absence really does make<lf>the heart grow fonder, eh?
