<string>I-I'm not cold at all! I'm in a fur coat here.
<string>I wanna go to a warmer Base Camp. Where's a Felyne<lf>find a paradise like that?
<string>Another day of giving the Support Team all<lf>I've got.
<string>I've never sipped a hot drink in all my life!<lf>That's the honest truth! It wasn't spicy at all!
<string>Alright, I'll be honest. I didn't think it would<lf>be <ITALIC>this</ITALIC> cold out here...
<string>I'm in charge of the Support Team here at Base<lf>Camp. Let's do the best we can, yeah?
<string>...This is some place we've come to, huh?
<string>I heard the mews, Hunter! A big VIP said you<lf>did a really great job, huh?
<string>I guess even my fur coat's powerless against<lf>a blizzard this bad...
<string>Make sure you bundle up tight, Hunter!
<string>You're not breaking me, blizzard! Blanket me in snow!<lf>...But just a normal blanket would be nice too...
<string>Even a hint of warmth in the air has a way<lf>of thawing people's hearts.
<string>That does it—I'm booking a tropical vacation.<lf>Know any good spots?
<string>I have reached enlightenment. As long as there's<lf>ground underfoot, anywhere can be home.
