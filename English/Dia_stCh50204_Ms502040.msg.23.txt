<string>Greetings, fisherfellow! You're beginning to look<lf>the proper angler, these days.
<string>Perhaps it's time I challenged you to catch<lf>something...bigger.
<string>Such as?
<string>I speak, of course, of...a <ITALIC>whopper</ITALIC>! The catch of<lf>every angler's dreams!
<string>It's huge! But that's the catch: they aren't easy<lf>to land, my friend.
<string>So let me give you the right lures for the job. <lf>Past that, you'll just have to converse with nature.
<string>Fair enough. I'll report back once I've caught<lf>one.
<string>Welcome back, dear fisherfellow! And what a<lf>glorious whopper you have in tow. Huzzah!
<string>Surely you feel it. How much you've improved as an<lf>angler, and—dare I say—a hunter as well?
<string>Maybe a little, sure.
<string>Oh, to be certain! I could not be prouder of my<lf>fellow fisherfellow's fishing, eh my good fellow?
<string>...But surely you're not satisfied? Not with so<lf>many untold whoppers yet waiting to be hooked!
<string>"If you're after a whopper, go broad or go deep."<lf>That's an iron law of angling.
<string>...Pretty obvious, I suppose. You're not going to<lf>find a big fish living in a puddle.
