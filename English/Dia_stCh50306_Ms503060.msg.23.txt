<string>Hunter, do you have a moment? I'm in a spot of<lf>trouble here...
<string>What's wrong?
<string>We've actually received a follow-up request from<lf>the Guild, related to the ecological survey.
<string>But it's a bit...challenging. I could have<lf>declined, of course, but...
<string>But you accepted, and now you're stuck.
<string>...Yes. My apologies. In my rush not to be outdone<lf>by Dareel, I bit off more than I could handle.
<string>Though, I am also excited to have the chance<lf>to work with you once more, Hunter.
<string>It can wait until you're free, naturally. But<lf>please, help me with this one final survey.
<string>Thank you, Hunter. I just saw confirmation that<lf>my request was completed.
<string>...And allow me to apologize. In my rush to get<lf>results, I pressured you into assisting me.
<string>It's fine. I know that feeling all too well.
<string>You're very kind. And hearing that from the<lf>colleague I trust most is very heartening.
<string>My survey work here is nearing its conclusion.<lf>Does it seem yours will continue awhile yet?
<string>Do stay safe. And may your investigation lead you<lf>to wonderful new discoveries.
<string>Sandstars remain largely a mystery. All we know<lf>for certain is that they're fast and glow.
<string>They dash across the sands at night like shooting<lf>stars, making them a bit difficult to capture.
<string>I also heard they have large ears! Enhanced hearing<lf>might mean they're sensitive to noise.
