<string>Any idea where she might have gone?
<string>We're looking for a monster den where<lf>auric oil can be gathered.
<string>I asked Yabran for some directions and gave<lf>the scent to our scoutflies.
<string>He said the exit near the Bonefolk is our best bet.
<string>I hope she's OK. Monsters aren't really friendly<lf>towards intruders...
<string>Is the Firespring Festival really that important?
<string>To the people of Azuz, it is.
<string>We should remember not to judge based on<lf>our biases.
<string>Upbringing, history, and culture shape<lf>our priorities.
<string>For Maki, the auric oil must be more important<lf>than anything.
<string>Then let's hurry for Maki AND Yabran!
<string>This whole region is like a sauna...
<string>Yeah, we need a way to beat the heat.
<string>Not to mention it reeks of crude. No wonder<lf>they call it the Oilwell Basin.
<string>In addition to oil, there's likely other useful<lf>materials like minerals and coal.
<string>Ohh, I'd love to look for some!
<string>Sure, but Maki comes first.
<string>Where did she run off to?
<string>Just follow the scoutflies.<lf>They know where to go.
<string>Yabran warned me that oil accumulates<lf>in this area very easily.
<string>It'll be like walking through tar. Best to avoid it.
<string>Understood. Let's be careful.
<string>That looks like a good place for a Pop-up Camp.
<string>The scent of oil is even stronger here...
<string>Does that mean we're getting close?
<string>Wouldn't want to get that in my fur.
<string>Tread carefully.
<string>The Rompopolo is a Brute Wyvern that favors<lf>swampy terrain.
<string>The gas it stores up and expels has poison<lf>and explosive properties. Stay clear of it!
<string>Good hunt! Now let's go find Maki.<lf>She can't have gone far.
<string>How can this be? The Firespring never<lf>fails to come!
<string>Forgive me, but if it's a natural phenomenon, there's not<lf>really any way of knowing when or if it will occur, correct?
<string>What are you talking about?<lf>Does the sun forget to rise?
<string>Exactly. The cycle of Fallow and Plenty<lf>is a natural constant!
<string>Constant?
<string>I'm not giving up now. We have to fix this.
<string>Uh, sorry to interrupt. But I think you all need<lf>to see this.
<string>Let's take a look.
<string>I'm told this helical beauty is known as<lf>the Landspine.
<string>There. Do you recognize those crystals?
<string>Is that...Wylk?
<string>Correct. And this network is its source.
<string>Look. The crystals are forming wherever<lf>the Landspine is damaged.
<string>But they were using Wylk in Kunafa, too,<lf>like it was nothing unusual at all.
<string>I think we can assume the Landspine stretches<lf>all across the Eastlands.
<string>Our friends here were using the Wylk to stoke<lf>their Everforge. But it's no ordinary fuel.
<string>And therein lies our enigma: What is it?<lf>What is this energy for?
