<string>Nice, another day of progress. Not mad about that.
<string>Aida's had her head on straight since she was<lf>little. Was always a good leader, too.
<string>Now, me? People skills were never my forte.<lf>I've always admired her.
<string>...What? I don't mind if you watch, but stay out<lf>of the way, yeah?
<string>You put in the hard work, you're gonna get results.<lf>That's what the festival is for us.
<string>The Firespring Festival always<lf>gets our blood pumping.
<string>The festival is... For us here in Azuz, it's what<lf>we're all living for.
<string>So...what's your story? Where're you from?<lf>You're sure dressed funny.
<string>Long as you're here, you should<lf>stay for the festival.
<string>...I don't even know.
<string>I just hope everybody's blood, sweat, and tears<lf>don't all end up wasted.
<string>You can see the worry on everybody's face.<lf>...No big surprise.
<string>I'm just as worried as them.
<string>...I don't really have time to chat right now.
<string>Thanks to you all, our festival is...<lf>No, <ITALIC>Azuz</ITALIC> is saved.
<string>I'm grateful.
<string>You see a lot more cross-tribe chatting these days.
<string>But there's definitely still a feeling of "why<lf>bother starting now?" to it.
<string>...Guess there's no reason to be stubborn about<lf>it, either.
<string>I hear the Firespring's delayed.<lf>That's a full-blown crisis here.
<string>Rgh, thing's really going full blast.
<string>This never-ending Firespring's a serious problem,<lf>but thankfully folks aren't panicking over it.
<string>Glad our tribes all have decent leaders<lf>holding 'em together.
<string>We can put up a good fight with the Everforge, but<lf>we can't do a damn thing about the Black Flame.
<string>Sorry, but some things just aren't possible.
<string>I guess you guys bailed us out again, huh?
<string>Aida does her share of worrying, too. But she<lf>can't let the others see her sweating, y'know?
<string>...Being a leader's tough.
<string>Things have been improving between the tribes<lf>bit by bit. We've got a good flow going.
<string>We weren't all feuding before or anything,<lf>but we weren't working together either.
<string>We can figure anything out if we put all our<lf>heads together.
