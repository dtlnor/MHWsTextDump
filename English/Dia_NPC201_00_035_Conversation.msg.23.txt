<string>I have seen true the contents of your heart.
<string>To stand watch over Suja is my charge.<lf>May you see your own completed.
<string>These days of quietude are a treasure.
<string>Good Hunter. The time is ripe to shed<lf>the weight of fear and soar.
<string>You soar with wings fit to rein the roughest gale.
<string>An age has passed since last I saw the Allhearken<lf>to that place of prayer.
<string>And still that time is not yet come. While danger<lf>waits, so too must we.
<string>I am told you are returned from Wounded Hollow...<lf>You are fierce as you are brave.
<string>Tame your wild heart.
<string>Tame your wild heart.
<string>I see. Then such is your path...
<string>Do you scale these Peaks alone solely to hear<lf>our lyric words? Ha ha...
<string>You returned Wounded Hollow to quietude, did you<lf>not? Your toils have allowed us entry once more.
<string>I am most grateful for this kindness.
<string>Good Hunter, borne aloft on mighty wings.
