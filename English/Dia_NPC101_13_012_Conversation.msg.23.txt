<string>We're still short on quality stone. We need to<lf>make up the difference before the festival...
<string>Ah! How have you been, Hunter?
<string>The Stonefolk are in top form!<lf>Prepare to go slack-jawed at the next festival.
<string>I want the next festival to be a success.<lf>Think you could pitch in and help?
<string>After the incredible last festival we had,<lf>you can't blame us for wanting to do it again.
<string>Everybody's raring to go—<lf>myself included, of course.
<string>That's <NUMBER {0}> successful festivals in a row,<lf>and counting! Outstanding!
<string>But just you wait till you see my people flex<lf>their talents at the next one, heh!
<string>Ho, friend of Azuz! Are you here to see the real<lf>festival? Good, good, we welcome you!
<string>I'll concede we were foolish, but it's no<lf>reason to let our fire and passion run cold.
<string>Lately, I've come to see beauty in the unchanging.<lf>I didn't appreciate that when I was younger.
<string>It's been one triumphant festival after another—<lf>so many that I've lost count, actually.
<string>This will go down in Stonefolk history as a<lf>legendary achievement. I can't contain my pride!
<string>Please feel free to explore Azuz while we wait<lf>for the Firespring Festival to begin, traveler.
<string>This time, we'll create Oricalcite beyond compare!<lf>This time, we'll succeed!
<string>As I was explaining to your companion here, I know<lf>nothing about this large white monster you seek.
<string>And believe me, I would've heard if<lf>something unusual came through.
<string>I'm no monster expert, but could it have gone in<lf>a different direction? To the desert, for example.
<string>I don't know what to say, traveler.<lf>This has never happened before.
<string>It's inconceivable for the Firespring not to come.
<string>The first thing to do is calm everyone down.<lf>Then we can puzzle over what happened.
<string>All we can do now is show this crisis what<lf>we're made of!
<string>Whew. For a while there, I thought we were cooked.
<string>Just between you and me, my heart was in my throat<lf>from start to finish. Ha ha ha!
<string>Oil, Stone, or Bone, I've noticed the young people<lf>of Azuz are really starting to pull their weight.
<string>I never would've thought such a little thing could<lf>make me this happy.
<string>No sign of the Firespring happening...<lf>It's a lot like the other time.
<string>I'll confer with the others.
<string>Don't worry about us.<lf>We'll handle things here—just you watch!
<string>When the heat is on—that's when you really<lf>need a cool head.
<string>I could really get used to having a monster<lf>specialist around.
<string>The homeland that produced you must be one<lf>incredible place.
<string>We'll never be able to do things your way, Hunter.<lf>The way we think and live—it's just too different.
<string>But that's all right. Maybe it's time we<lf>renegotiated our place in nature on our own terms.
<string>When all three tribes work together,<lf>there's no obstacle Azuz can't overcome.
<string>Especially when the best tribe, the Stonefolk,<lf>are involved! Ga ha ha!
<string>Don't tell Aida and Yabran I said that.

<string>Well, look who's here! I'd welcome you as a guest,<lf>but we're beyond all that now, aren't we?
<string>Azuz is your home, too. Now when are you gonna<lf>settle down here, huh?

<string>Until it failed, I'd never questioned the smoke<lf>that kept monsters out of Azuz...
<string>That smoke has kept our village safe for ages.
<string>Which means nobody has any clue why they suddenly<lf>showed up this one time...
<string>It feels like we've got some learning to do around<lf>here. Bit by bit.
<string>Do monsters never enter the village?
<string>You see the smoke rising up all over Azuz?<lf>The monsters can't stand the smell of it.
<string>So there's no need to worry. Kick back<lf>and relax until the festival starts.
