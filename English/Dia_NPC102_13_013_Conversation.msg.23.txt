<string>Our material gathering has been slow going,<lf>so everyone's rushing to pick up the slack.
<string>The Bonefolk are fired up and ready to deliver.<lf>You don't want to miss this next festival.
<string>We want the next festival to be a success.<lf>Any help you could provide would be welcome.
<string>The last festival was a smashing success,<lf>but the Bonefolk don't rest on our laurels!
<string>It's on to the next achievement!
<string>So many good festivals. What are we up to,<lf><NUMBER {0}> in a row now?
<string>The Bonefolk are making their chief proud!<lf>Let's keep this streak going!
<string>Everything we do is for this moment! These last,<lf>nail-biting jitters are what it's all about!
<string>Do you feel the spirit yet? Everyone in Azuz has<lf>poured their heart into this one moment.
<string>Azuz needs to think about what it will do the<lf>next time a problem like the Black Flame arises...
<string>That's a task that falls to us chiefs.
<string>It feels great to have so many festivals go well—<lf>and on our watch, to boot.
<string>The Bonefolk aren't <ITALIC>capable</ITALIC> of failure!<lf>...Right, now I'm getting carried away.
<string>But the Bonefolk are the greatest—<lf>that much will always be true!
<string>The Firespring <ITALIC>always</ITALIC> comes after the Fallow.<lf>For it not to is...it's simply not possible.
<string>That man who was staring at the Everforge...<lf>What was he doing?
<string>Come! Let's face this challenge as one!<lf>Together, we can get through this!
<string>We let the dream of a daily Firespring cloud<lf>our judgment... We wanted to take, take, take.
<string>But the Firespring, Fallow, and Plenty come<lf>and go as they do for a reason.
<string>Us chiefs have begun meeting to discuss our<lf>future... Our tribes will need to come together.
<string>No Firespring. This is concerning.
<string>But first, we must gather information.
<string>The Firespring rages on, but we'll be all right.<lf>The tribes are working together.
<string>We'll figure things out. Don't worry.
<string>The Firespring has been unpredictable lately,<lf>and we're still struggling to get used to it.
<string>Were we mistaken to think that nature occurs<lf>in precise cycles?
<string>Back where you hail from, how in the world did<lf>they come up with the idea of hunters?
<string>That's not to criticize. I just want to understand<lf>how your people and ours turned out so different.
<string>I intend to make a record of what happened here,<lf>so that future generations will be ready.
<string>Until now, we never made an effort to<lf>understand nature.
<string>To us, it was something you simply accepted,<lf>something that could never be defied.
<string>Meeting you has taught me that we are stronger<lf>for questioning, for learning. Thank you.
<string>Even after all we've been through, the Bonefolk<lf>are still Azuz's greatest tribe.
<string>And you can tell Yabran and Dogard I said that,<lf>because it's true.
