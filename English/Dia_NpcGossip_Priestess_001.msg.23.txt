<string>Nice weather again today, hmm?
<string>Oh yes, just lovely.
<string>The Allhearken offered her prayers again today.
<string>I wonder if she heard something on the winds.
<string>I hear they picked some ripe Wyvangos earlier.
<string>That will be a treat.
<string>The climate outside has begun to change.
<string>Do you suppose it will affect Suja?
<string>If anything arises, we'll work together with the<lf>Giant Wyverians.
<string>The meal we were served the other day was quite<lf>the feast.
<string>Yes, it seems a voice arrived.
<string>Ahh, that would explain it.
