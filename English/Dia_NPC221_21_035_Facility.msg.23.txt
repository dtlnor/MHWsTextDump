<string>How do you do?
<string>My years have granted me the gift of knowledge about<lf>this world's creatures, and I am eager to share.
<string>Good to see you so spry.
<string>I suppose you can handle matters from here.
<string>Be careful, now.

<string>I'd like to review our research.
<string>How have things been lately?
<string>(End Conversation)
<string>Oh, Hunter. Thank you kindly for helping capture wildlife.
<string>I've got all the information you could want stored<lf>in my noggin about the creatures you've caught.
<string>That is all for now. I look forward<lf>to your continued support.
<string>Ah, salutations, Hunter! I'm in a bit of a quandary.<lf>Might I trouble you for your assistance?
<string>You see, I had a list Samin made of aquatica to be collected,<lf>with the intention of giving it to you.
<string>However, mere moments ago, a strong breeze<lf>scattered all five pages to the wind...
<string>Drat! I have a vague recollection of what was written<lf>about the aquatica we wanted you to collect...
<string>You'll be compensated for your time, of course!<lf>Think of this as an advance!
<string>Now then, what was written on that first page... I will<lf>endeavor to jog my memory, so please check back later.
<string>Do you remember those fish yet?
<string>Ah, yes, I vaguely recall the first page of the list of<lf>aquatica we wanted you to collect!
<string>I believe it was 10 fish of any kind, as long as<lf>their scales glimmer of gold and silver.
<string>No need to bring them all here. Recording them<lf>in your Field Guide is enough. You have my thanks!
<string>Ah, yes, I vaguely recall the second page of the<lf>list of aquatica we wanted you to collect!
<string>I believe it was 10 fish of any kind, as long<lf>as they're useful for hunting.
<string>From eating to sharpening, fish have many uses!<lf>Just record them in your Field Guide, thank you kindly!
<string>I vaguely recall the third page of the list<lf>of aquatica we wanted you to collect!
<string>I believe it was 5 fish of any kind, as long as they're<lf>large and can swim relatively fast.
<string>Curse this confounded memory of mine! Oh, and don't<lf>forget to record them in your Field Guide, thank you!
<string>I vaguely recall the fourth page of the list of<lf>aquatica we wanted you to collect!
<string>I believe it was 5 fish of any kind, as long as they<lf>prefer murky and dark places.
<string>Urgh... My first blunder in eight years! Just remember<lf>to record them in your Field Guide, thank you!
<string>I vaguely recall the fifth page of the list of<lf>aquatica we wanted you to collect!
<string>I believe it was 10 aquatic creatures of any kind,<lf>as long as they possess wriggling tentacles.
<string>Ngh... They're so wriggly! Please record them in<lf>your Field Guide. Your assistance is appreciated!
<string>These fish certainly glimmer of gold and silver!
<string>You have my undying gratitude!<lf>Please, take this as a token of our appreciation!
<string>These fish are certainly useful for hunting!
<string>I cannot begin to thank you enough!<lf>Please, take this as a token of our appreciation!
<string>These fish are certainly quick despite their size!
<string>You have earned my heartfelt thanks!<lf>Please, take this as a token of our appreciation!
<string>These fish certainly prefer their<lf>environs murky and dark!
<string>We are profoundly in your debt!<lf>Please, take this as a token of our appreciation!
<string>The appendages of these aquatic creatures certainly<lf>do wriggle!
<string>There are no words to express our gratitude!<lf>Please, take this as a token of our appreciation!
<string>You've done it, Hunter! You've gathered data on every<lf>page of the list of aquatica! We are eternally grateful!
<string>Ah, my first tears of gratitude in eight years...<lf>Your generosity is truly the stuff of legends!
