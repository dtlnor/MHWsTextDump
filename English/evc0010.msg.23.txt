<string>Incredible...
<string>So much diversity!
<string>Look at the size...!
<string>The water's red!
<string>Why, though?
<string>It'll be a fun mystery to unravel.
<string>Heeey!
<string>Over here!
<string>So, the forest is full of symbiotic systems<lf>involving the roots, leaves, flowers, and fruit...
<string>And it's the insects' job to pollinate.
<string>They have this fascinating process where they coat their bodies<lf>in the pollen— which is called "entomophily," by the way—
<string>It's an example of two living things<lf>scratching each other's backs, basically.
<string>I knew you'd show up.
<string>Glad we didn't disappoint!
<string>We'll give you a hand.
<string>Thanks.
<string>So Captain, what's your team been gettin' up to?
<string>Please, call me Olivia.
<string>The Guild gave special assignments to some<lf>of the other units from the expedition.
<string>Mine included.
<string>Wait, are you guys an ace team?
<string>Let me introduce you. Erik, our biologist.
<string>Have you two met before?
<string>Met? Oh, no. But I've definitely heard of him!
<string>He was famous back at the Academy.
<string>This forest is AMAZING! I am NEVER leaving.
<string>Anyway... Over there's Werner,<lf>our engineer...
<string>Perhaps you've heard of him too?
<string>He's one of the big brains behind<lf>the Wyvern's Fire technology.
<string>Wait, WHAAAT?
<string>We are SO gonna talk later, pal!
