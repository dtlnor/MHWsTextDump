<string>Talk to Alma
<string>A Hunter's Pride
<string>The Hunter's investigation in the woods reveals that the Doshaguma have overcome their fear of humans and formed a pack, led by an alpha. It's only a matter of time before they descend on Kunafa. The Avis Unit races back to warn the village.

<string>Talk to Nata in the Plains Base Camp
<string>Beyond the Deluge
<string>The Avis Unit learns that Olivia and Erik's investigation into the White Wraith has brought them into the remotest reaches of the forest. Eager to hear their report and deliver Seikret for the pair's use, they ride through the rain into the forest's depths...
<string>Head to the depths of the Scarlet Forest
<string>Repel the Uth Duna
<string>Talk to Olivia
<string>A Looming Shadow
<string>Nata confirms that the monster they saw through the downpour was their target— the White Wraith. The boy's long- suppressed rage boils to the surface and erupts. With the weather cleared and the monster nowhere in sight, the Avis Unit makes for the forest in search of its trail.
<string>Finish your preparations and talk to Alma
<string>Go to the Wudwuds
<string>Toward Fervent Fields
<string>Zatoh tells of a land where the earth bleeds oil and its artisans who practice ancient crafting techniques. The Avis Unit sets out to meet the three tribes he spoke of to learn their ways and—with any luck—to hear word of the Keepers.

<string>Talk to Alma

<string>Talk to Werner in Azuz
<string>Hopes of Home
<string>The people of Azuz lead the way to what appears to be an underground passage. Nata recognizes it immediately—beyond it lies the Keepers' village. The boy's heart soars at the prospect of seeing his home once more.

<string>A Disquieting Dawn
<string>Suspecting that the Landspine is a man-made structure closely tied to the strange energy they've witnessed, the Hunter and company make for Azuz to attempt to dissuade Werner from moving forward with its repair.
<string>Search for Werner in Azuz
<string>Long-forgotten Flame
<string>Perhaps due to the recent repairs to the Landspine, a sudden Firespring hits Azuz. The sudden change stokes the Everforge into an uncontrollable frenzy. The fury of nearby Ajarakan is equally sparked, and the Hunter springs into action to protect the village.
<string>Repel the Ajarakan
<string>Hunt the Ajarakan
<string>Search for the Black Flame
<string>Hunt the Nu Udra
<string>Born from the Flame
<string>With the threat to Azuz abated, the expedition team reflects on their recent discoveries: the suspected man-made Landspine, and the likelihood that the region's unique ecological cycle derives from it. They return to the first Base Camp to discuss their next steps.
<string>Talk to Rosso in the Windward Plains
<string>The Faithful Keepers
<string>After the events in Azuz, it has become clear that the Landspine is likely an artificial structure from which the region derives its unique ecological cycle. With the ice that blocked the underground passage now melted, the Avis Unit once again makes for the Keepers' village.

<string>Talk to Olivia in the Iceshard Cliffs

<string>Slay the Guardian Arkveld
<string>Visions of Hope
<string>Within the Dragontorch lurks Zoh Shia, Wyveria's secret weapon and ultimate Guardian. Stopping the torch would ensure the monster's demise—and the collapse of the entire ecosystem. Nata resolves to fulfill his duty as a Keeper as the Hunter stands beside him.
<string>Talk to Nata
<string>Monster Hunter
<string>Within the Dragontorch lurks Zoh Shia, Wyveria's secret weapon and ultimate Guardian. As Nata hesitates to fulfill his duty, the Hunter steps up and offers him a different solution. The time to slay Zoh Shia has arrived.
<string>Slay Zoh Shia
<string>A Visitor from the West
<string>In light of the expedition team's resounding success, the Guild discusses further relations with the Eastlands, allowing the hunter and company to reunite with a certain accomplished veteran.
<string>Talk to Olivia
<string>New Ecosystems
<string>Free of Zoh Shia's influence, the energy from the Dragontorch has put the entire Eastlands into a season of Plenty. The Avis Unit has been deployed to the Scarlet Forest to investigate. Excited for new discoveries, they advance further into the forest.

<string>While out investigating, the Hunter receives word from Fabius. The Avis Unit departs for Suja to learn why they were called upon.
<string>Talk to Fabius in Suja
<string>Lurking Shadows

<string>To Wyvern's Rest
<string>Olivia summons Avis Unit after encountering something of interest at Wyvern's Rest. This is the first time the group will set foot in the area since slaying Zoh Shia.
<string>Talk to Olivia at the Ruins of Wyveria
<string>Wyvern Sparks and Rose Thorns
<string>A Lala Barina was spotted in the Ruins of Wyveria, mysteriously far from its natural habitat. Under the assumption that it must possess abnormal traits, the potential harm to the region cannot be ignored. The Hunter departs to investigate at Olivia's behest.

<string>Investigate the regions and raise your HR
<string>Talk to Nata at the Oilwell Basin
<string>Storm-cold Vortex
<string>A tip from Nata clued the Hunter in on a frozen section of the Wyrmway. The cause seems related to the unending blizzards in the Iceshard Cliffs and the Jin Dahaad that resides there. The group ventures there, hoping to find a way to fix the flow of energy.
<string>Talk to Alma
<string>Slay the Jin Dahaad
<string>The Root Cause
<string>The energy spilling from the Dragontorch seems to be the source of all the anomalies, which leaves only one place for Avis Unit to go: the Ruins of Wyveria, where the Dragontorch lies.
<string>Investigate the regions and raise your HR
<string>A Torrent of Energy
<string>Upon slaying the Jin Dahaad, the Landspine returns to its normal state. However, the Dragontorch continues to emit excessive amounts of energy. With this problem on their minds, Avis Unit continues to investigate the regions.
<string>Talk to Olivia at the Ruins of Wyveria
<string>A World Turned Upside Down
<string>On top of a presumed connection between the excess energy from the Dragontorch and extreme weather conditions, Fabius reports that a Gore Magala is in the Eastlands. To address these simultaneous incidents, the Hunter has been tasked to go around and investigate each problem.

<string>Nata, who has been supporting the Guild as an apprentice since the defeat of Zoh Shia, has a report for the Hunter. The group goes to hear what he has to say.
<string>Talk to Nata in the Windward Plains
<string>What Lies Ahead
<string>Against all odds, Arkveld has been reborn. While symbolizing the indomitability of nature, its very characteristics have ironically made it a force that cannot be ignored. Deducing that it will appear next at the Rey Dau's nest, the Hunter sets off.
