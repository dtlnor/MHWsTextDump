<string>No surprise to see the weather's no more normal<lf>here than elsewhere...
<string>It seems Maki was looking for us. Let's go talk to her.
<string>Alright.
<string>Hey. You're here.
<string>I need to talk to you about a monster.<lf>The Black Flame— Nu Udra...or something?
<string>Let's hear it.
<string>Give me a few moments, please.
<string>Thanks. I'll call the others in, then.
<string>Sure. Just let me know when you're ready.
<string>So, what was it you wanted to share?
<string>That thing... It's just outside the village.
<string>I'll bet it's after the Everforge.

<string>Doesn't look too different, but it's running hot.<lf>No time to cool, with the Firespring never ending.
<string><COLOR FF0000>#Rejected#</COLOR> Dia_stCh0904_Ms009090_0030_t006
<string>Yeah, and it's not just the Everforge. Whole<lf>Basin's hot enough to fry a Great Ape!
<string>Maybe that's why the Nu Udra's throwing such<lf>a fit. Way worse than last time.
<string>But we've got our heads on straight this time.<lf>We'll get through this.
<string>Everyone's already working at a fever pitch<lf>to keep the Everforge from getting any hotter.
<string><COLOR FF0000>#Rejected#</COLOR> Dia_stCh0904_Ms009090_0030_t011
<string>...I hope that's not just wishful thinking.
<string>What are you talking about? The three clans are<lf>all pitching in. There's no flame we cannot wrangle.
<string>It seems what happened last time sparked<lf>some real growth here.
<string>It's wonderful to see the clans cooperating<lf>with one another like this.
<string>Yeah... It made me happy. Gemma and the others<lf>taught us how important working together really is.
<string>It made me think maybe we could actually take care<lf>of the village ourselves. Everyone in Azuz.
<string>I'm sure. I could feel how passionate everyone<lf>was, then.
<string>And we are! Since the Firespring started, we've<lf>all been working with no breaks. Working hard...
<string>But I feel like there are some things even hard<lf>work can't fix.
<string>By swallowing the valley's fire, the Black Flame<lf>has grown way hotter than last time.
<string>It's safe to assume it's been affected by<lf>sustained exposure to this weather anomaly...
<string>Even if we can keep the Everforge in one piece,<lf>that monster is something we can't handle.
<string>If someone doesn't stop it, it's gonna burn up<lf>the whole basin, the Everforge AND all of us.
<string>So, please... Help us!
<string>Don't worry. We will.
<string>No objections, Alma?
<string>None. In response to the crisis at hand,<lf>the Guild authorizes you to hunt the Nu Udra.
<string>Understood.
<string>The scoutflies are responding... It really is close<lf>to the village. Let's hurry!
<string>There it is. Right on Azuz's doorstep!
<string>We can't let that thing get any closer.
<string>Right. We stop it here!
<string>Amazing... Are these...Nu Udra eggs?

<string>When you're ready, accept the quest<lf>to continue the investigation.
<string>Well done. The village was spared from harm,<lf>thanks to your efforts. Let's go back and report.
<string>Oh, thank blazes you're back in one piece!
<string>And thank you, for saving the basin and...<lf>And all of us in it!

<string>Let me second that. You've given me cause for<lf>a good, long think on the meaning of unity.
<string>Just like manning the Everforge and smithing work<lf>is our wheelhouse, monsters are yours.
<string>We should've asked your help sooner.<lf>That's another lesson Maki here's taught us.
<string>If you wanted to even the score, you could teach<lf>me some new techniques. I'm bored of the basics!
<string>You give her an inch, and just look... Bah, fine.<lf>I'll hammer some smarts into you and Roqul later.
<string>...But we can't relax until the Firespring subsides.<lf>We'll protect this village, our own way.
<string>Good. We can rest easy knowing Azuz is<lf>in capable hands.
<string>Which means, we're free to continue looking into<lf>these weather anomalies. Take care of each other.
