<string>Ahh, Hunter! You've come at the perfect time!
<string>Forgive my forwardness, but might you help with<lf>the monsters newly come to Wounded Hollow?
<string>There are no prior reports of the species there. The<lf>people of Suja are also worried for travelers' safety.
<string>But sadly, I am unable to leave my post here...<lf>I would be very grateful if you looked into it!
<string>Alright. I'll take care of it.
<string>Thank you very much! Luckily, there have been no<lf>reports of harm or ill effects on the area as yet.
<string>I'm certain you will bring a swift resolution to<lf>the matter and ensure that stays the case.
<string>Understood, thanks.
<string>Oh, that reminds me. Have you been informed that<lf>Ms. Gemma has completed repairs on the fence?
<string>When facing multiple monsters, it can be used to<lf>divide and conquer, or to trap them all in one spot.
<string>However you choose to make use of it, I am certain<lf>you'll find it a most helpful tool.
<string>I'll be sure to keep that in mind.<lf>Thanks for the tip.
<string>Of course! Then I shall leave you to it.<lf>Take care, and good hunting!
<string>Welcome back! I am very glad to see you safe.
<string>I am pleased to say there have been no injury<lf>reports regarding your quest to the Wounded Hollow.
<string>I would expect no less from someone hand-picked by<lf>Sir Fabius! You are truly an inspiration, Hunter.
<string>OK, easy... I'm flattered, but...<lf>Let's not get crazy.
<string>I merely expressed a fraction of my<lf>gratitude and admiration, but if you insist.
<string>In any case, I will be eagerly awaiting tales of<lf>your next accomplishments, Hunter!
<string>Thanks. Good luck with your mission here as well.
<string>Oh, thank you! I will see it done!
