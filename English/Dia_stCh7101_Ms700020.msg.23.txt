<string>Do you have a moment?<lf>Werner said he wants to talk to you.
<string>He said he needs you in Suja. It's urgent.
<string>Ah, hey. We need to talk about the Dragontorch.
<string>Let's hear it.
<string>It'll have to wait a bit.
<string>Hang on. Olivia's here too.<lf>I'll go fetch her, so stay put.
<string>Fine. But come back when you're done.
<string>Avis Unit... Did Werner send for you? Well,<lf>we have an update regarding the Dragontorch.
<string>We had that area sealed off, but the Allhearken<lf>has given us a troubling report.
<string>Yes. Faint whispers began to reach my ears.
<string>At first, I could not identify them, but now the<lf>sensations are keen: the stirrings of life.
<string>You don't mean Zoh Shia?
<string>Unfortunately. We've discovered multiple<lf>budding cocoons on site.
<string>We removed many of the small ones, but it seems<lf>to have had no effect on the majority.
<string>And this is where you say, "Let's stop the<lf>Dragontorch." So let me remind you:
<string>You can't do that! It's an unstudied biological<lf>energy source. There's no replacement!
<string>Yes, I'm aware. I had no intention of suggesting<lf>that under the circumstances.
<string>Good. Wait, really?
<string>Alright, then why don't you let us check it out?
<string>Yes. Would you be willing to put your faith<lf>in us again?
<string>Of course. No one knows what we're up against<lf>better than your unit.
<string>As for me, I have merely come to relay<lf>what I had heard.
<string>I'll make my own preparations and stand by for<lf>your SOS flare. Be careful, Avis Unit.
<string>Can you believe it? I thought we were done with<lf>Zoh Shia... We can't go in underprepared.
<string>Right. I'll come find you once I'm ready to go.
<string>I'll be here.
<string>I can't leave without Alma.
<string>I should go talk to Alma.
<string>I've no objections and no doubt in your abilities.
<string>Please take my decision to stay back<lf>as proof of that trust.
<string>As I said before, while small, we saw<lf>numerous cocoons.
<string>I suspect it's not a separate entity or a simple<lf>regeneration, but more like a proliferation.
<string>I know you wish to deal with this on your own.
<string>And I respect that, but our priority is to resolve<lf>the problem. Call me if you need help.
<string>I called you guys because I didn't know how Olivia<lf>was going to react.
<string>But I know this doesn't mean her doubts about<lf>the Dragontorch have disappeared.
<string>I'm sure she just chose the best solution for the<lf>situation. Works well enough for me.
<string>Rebirth, revival, I don't know what<lf>the right word is...
<string>But it's sure something else if it has a built-in<lf>function like this. I'm impressed.
<string>We already took care of it, so how...?
<string>No. We don't even know where the thing came<lf>from in the first place.
<string>But maybe this incident will give us a clue.
<string>You'll call us if you need backup.
<string>Livvie and I trust that. That's why we can see you<lf>off without worry.
<string>Speaking from experience, these types of cases<lf>usually aren't straightforward.
<string>Even more so when you consider the opponent.
<string>To imagine the whispers were speaking of this.
<string>There are still many things that even I do not<lf>know. It is a refreshing feeling.
<string>I can't believe it's Zoh Shia...
<string>I don't think the choice you made<lf>last time was wrong.
<string>And I feel the same now. I believe in you, Hunter.
<string>Why is Zoh Shia back, though? More importantly,<lf>how should we handle it?
<string>Well, I guess it's the same answer as always:<lf>I'll do what I have to as a hunter.
<string>Right, of course. Just...be careful.
<string>Shall we head for the Dragontorch? Or would<lf>you like to check a different quest, first?
<string>Let's go.
<string>I'd like to see the quest list.
<string>Sorry, I'm still preparing.
<string>OK. I wish you the best of luck.
<string>We'll leave once you're one hundred percent ready.
<string>You did it before, you'll do it again.<lf>I believe in you! But...be careful.
<string>I imagine it won't be the same as before. It might<lf>be best to observe our opponent first.
<string>Could its revival be a result of the Dragontorch?<lf>Or is it due to its own life force?
<string>Something is definitely different from before.<lf>We should be careful.
<string>Fire! Look out!
<string>Uh-oh! It's igniting the crystals!
<string>Flames! The Wylkrystal is going to ignite!
<string>Did you see that!? That hunka-whatever was on fire!
<string>Yeah. We have to destroy the Wylkrystals before<lf>the fire spreads.
<string>Even the Wylkrystals are on fire! We have<lf>to destroy them before the fire spreads.
<string>Guess it still knows how to regenerate.<lf>I need to attack it before that happens.
<string>There! It's spilling energy! Now's my chance!
<string>This one is stronger than the one you faced<lf>before. Make sure to prepare well.
<string>Don't forget to replenish any supplies. You can<lf>never be too careful, no matter your skill.
<string>This isn't an opponent we can underestimate.<lf>Don't hesitate to use an SOS Flare.
<string>The size of those flames... It's using the<lf>Wylkrystals to spread the fire.
<string>You might mitigate the threat if you destroy the<lf>crystals before it can ignite them.
<string>If we don't prevent the Wylkrystals from catching<lf>fire, you'll be surrounded by flames again.
<string>However, considering the properties of Wylk,<lf>there should be a way to destroy them.
<string>Wylk reacts to elemental energy. I wonder if we<lf>can take advantage of that.
<string>You might be able to destroy them by shooting<lf>elemental energy into the Wylkrystals!
<string>We should have known it would be a challenge...<lf>Prepare, keep a clear head, and try again.
<string>We're here for this exact reason. Call on Olivia.
<string>Her equipment is all my own work, of course.
<string>I can't wait to see how it holds up against<lf>Wyveria's secret weapon.
<string>I was updated on the situation. It seems this one<lf>is truly on a level of its own.
<string>I respect you for wanting to take it on alone,<lf>but I'm ready anytime. Just send the signal.
<string>I don't believe words of encouragement alone will<lf>be enough in this situation.
<string>We're here to offer our skills. I hope you will<lf>call on us if needed.
<string>You did it! I knew you'd pull through.
<string>It seems that Erik's arrived. Let's head back<lf>and see what he's been up to.
<string>Welcome back. I'm glad you're all safe.
<string>Nice job. Now I can continue my research on<lf>that thing.
<string>Indeed. But...how did Zoh Shia revive?
<string>I've been wondering the same thing. Based on<lf>the information we have...
<string>My best guess is that it can self-propagate through<lf>something akin to asexual reproduction.
<string>So, if some of it somehow survives, even a little<lf>piece, it could become another adult?
<string>That's IF it's supplied with energy... Wyveria's<lf>"final line of defense" is nothing to sniff at.
<string>In which case—and I'm simply being honest here—<lf>can we truly allow the Dragontorch to exist?
<string>It's a conundrum. But this region survives despite—<lf>no, alongside that conundrum.
<string>So you're saying we just keep an eye on it<lf>and make sure things don't fall apart?
<string>Well, that's why we're here, isn't it? It's our "duty."<lf>Geez, I'm starting to sound like you.
<string>Yes, until we understand how Zoh Shia regenerates,<lf>we keep monitoring it and the Dragontorch.
<string>We'll all be working on this problem together, with the<lf>Keepers' and the Allhearken's blessing, of course.
<string>Right. We'll see how this unfolds.<lf>At the moment, that's our best option.
