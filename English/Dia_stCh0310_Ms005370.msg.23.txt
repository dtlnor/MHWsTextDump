<string>Let's do this!
<string>Yeah!
<string>It's doing something to the area... Not good!
<string>It's like an inferno!
<string>It's behaving differently! Be careful!
<string>What is that? It's jet black!
<string>That must mean... no, there's no way.
<string>Its crystals are regenerating! We need to attack<lf>them before that happens!
<string>It's leaking energy! Now's our chance!
<string>Awright, it's time to finish this. You've got<lf>this, Hunter. No problem!
<string>We'll take another path forward. A path I doubt<lf>any could walk but you!
<string>That being, Zoh Shia... I get the sense that it<lf>isn't a simple Guardian.
<string>What it <ITALIC>is,</ITALIC> I'm still not sure...
<string>Hunter! I... uh... Good luck.
<string>Ever since Arkveld attacked my village, I wondered<lf>if it was right for me to run away by myself.
<string>But I'm glad that I ran. Glad I was pushed to.<lf>Glad to be alive.
<string>And so, so glad to have met you.
<string>Hunter!
<string>Are you all right?
<string>Let's check over your equipment and get you resupplied!
<string>Zoh Shia... It's a being beyond description.
<string>No wonder the people of Wyveria called<lf>it their secret weapon...
<string>I'll be watching, Hunter. I...believe in you!
<string>The white feather-like covering on its head and<lf>wingarms look like crystallized Wyvern Milk.
<string>That might be where its energy is concentrated—<lf>and a good place to focus your attacks.
