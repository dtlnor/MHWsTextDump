<string>A word, Hunter? I can't help feeling that there has to<lf>be some root cause for these continued Inclemencies.
<string>Why don't we go and speak with Olivia<lf>and the others?
<string>Agreed. Let's go.

<string>Good timing. Fabius just returned—and not<lf>by coincidence, I'm beginning to suspect.
<string>Fabius is here? I wonder if he was able to draw any<lf>conclusions from that Frenzy sample.
<string>That seems likely, but we still haven't heard<lf>the details ourselves.
<string>Let's get everyone together.
<string>I apologize for my late return. It seems you all<lf>have had your hands full during my absence.
<string>Allow me to give my report first.
<string>Did you find anything in that sample from<lf>the Wounded Hollow?

<string><COLOR FF0000>#Rejected#</COLOR> Dia_stCh0803_Ms008060_0030_t005
<string>Yes. There is no mistaking it. That Nerscylla<lf>carried a pure strain of Frenzy Virus.

<string>Seeing as this topic is a focus of my research,<lf>I intend to assist with this investigation personally.

<string>Then it must be dire indeed. Allow me to share<lf>what we've learned next.
<string>Though it's probably better you see it for yourself.<lf>If you would follow me, sir.
<string>Of course. Lead the way.
<string>Hmm, so that serves as a sort of...energy network<lf>stemming from the Dragontorch.
<string>That's right. And as you saw on the way here,<lf>those energy surges show no sign of slowing.

<string>Perhaps it bears a relation, but essentially all of the East<lf>has been experiencing sustained Inclemencies.
<string><COLOR FF0000>#Rejected#</COLOR> Dia_stCh0803_Ms008060_0031_t005
<string>Hmm... Then you suspect some sort of link between<lf>those anomalies and the Dragontorch?
<string><COLOR FF0000>#Rejected#</COLOR> Dia_stCh0803_Ms008060_0031_t007
<string>Energy's spilling out of it, same as here. Same as<lf>the whole damn region. That explains your weather.
<string>You don't think... There isn't a chance that Zoh<lf>Shia was actually keeping the system in balance?
<string>Relax, there's no chance of that. What we're<lf>seeing now is clearly a reaction. To what, who knows.
<string>...I see. That's a tidy pile of mysteries set<lf>before us. But our job here remains the same.
<string>Alright. I'll begin my search for traces of Gore<lf>Magala. You all return to work but be ready to act.

<string>Intensifying energy eruptions, paired with weather<lf>anomalies across the region, and now a Gore Magala?
<string>Complicated issues, but the professor<lf>trusts in us so let's do our part.
<string>Agreed. Should probably start by visiting each<lf>Base Camp. See where we stand.
<string>Good thinking. I leave the destination to you then.
