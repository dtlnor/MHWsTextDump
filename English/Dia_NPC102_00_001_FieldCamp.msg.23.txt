<string>I imagine we could set up camp over there.
<string>I see Quatreflies.
<string>I think we could set up camp over there.<lf>Want to check it out?
<string>This place might be a little hazardous for<lf>a campsite. We should be extra careful.
<string>We should reduce our load if we're going<lf>to set up camp here.
<string>This should be far enough away from any monster<lf>habitats. Do you want to set up camp here?
<string>I bet we could set up camp here.
<string>This might be a nice place to set up camp.
<string>Look at all the Quatreflies! This place must be safe.
<string>I had no idea such a place existed! Why not set<lf>up a campsite here?
<string>We should set up camp here! It would<lf>be a great place to pass the time.
<string>Ooh, how rustic! Well, shall we give it a spin?
<string>That feeling when you see that perfect roast...<lf>You just want to tear into it!
<string>Beautifully done! I was excited just watching you.
<string>No worries, this model takes some<lf>time getting used to.
<string>I'm sure you'll get it next time.
<string>Shall we take a little break? I can brew us some tea.
<string>Ohh! I've been dreaming of this! Please, leave<lf>it to me! I'll fix you a perfect cup of tea!
<string>Sometimes it's nice to just take a breather.
<string>Oh, yes please. Give me just a moment and I'll<lf>prepare you a nice, hot cup of tea.
<string>How about we get some tea going?
<string>That's a lovely idea. I'll serve you a cup of tea<lf>that'll restore your spirits.
<string>Tea sounds lovely. You'll join me, won't you?
<string>What do you say to a little change of pace?<lf>Tea will be included, of course.
<string>How many people have been given comfort by this<lf>aroma over the years, I wonder...
<string>I'll never get tired of this little ritual.
<string>...Oh! Right. Back to business?
<string>Slowly, patiently... Ah! The quest list, yes?
<string>Thank you for your patience. I'm quite satisfied<lf>with the result.
<string>Ahh, so fragrant.
<string>Here you are, please enjoy.
<string>Thanks, that's very kind of you.
<string>Please, help yourself!
<string>Thank you. It smells great.
<string>I hope you enjoyed it. It's my pleasure.
<string>It's important to treasure these moments.
<string>That was a delightful little break. Let's chat<lf>again sometime soon.
<string>That was the perfect break. Now then, shall we get<lf>back to the investigation?
<string>Let's maybe wait on the tea until the weather has<lf>settled down a bit.
<string>The sky is looking a little suspicious.<lf>It pains me, but we should probably postpone.
<string>Oh, that's a monster! We'll have to pick<lf>this back up later!
<string>Let's pick this up again later, OK?
<string>I'll bet Erik could tell us all sorts of stories<lf>about the endemic life that turns up here.
<string>What sort of endemic life do you think we'll find?
<string>Observing endemic life is always fun. A perfect<lf>mix of educational and adorable.
<string>Is this a substrate for cultivating mushrooms?<lf>This will make visiting camp even more exciting.
<string>What do you suppose will sprout here?
<string>Mushroom update...stable! Looks like all's well.
<string>Oh, look! The mushrooms look ready to harvest.
<string>Wait, is that...!? Look, a special mushroom!<lf>We sprouted a rare one!
<string>It looks like we missed our chance to harvest the<lf>mushrooms here. Let's keep better track next time.
<string>We've lost some of our harvest here. Waited too<lf>long, I'm afraid. Some still look viable, though!
