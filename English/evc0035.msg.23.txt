<string>Tasheen! It's me! I'm home!
<string>Tasheen! Are you here?
<string>Tasheeeen!
<string>Nata, is that you?
<string>Nata!
<string>Tasheen!
<string>You're alive...Nata.
<string>I did what you said. I stayed strong.
<string>And you were right. About people.
<string>These are my friends. They helped me<lf>find my way back.
<string>Thank you... Thank you...
<string>We're from a land to the far west, beyond the desert.
<string>Brave Nata here crossed the sands<lf>on his own to look for help.
<string>You made that trek alone?
<string>I... I had no idea there were other<lf>people living so far away.
<string>Please, come with me. Let us rest and talk.
<string>(monster roaring)
<string>No!
<string>Go! It's trying to get inside!
<string>Tasheen! Tasheeeen!
<string>A Rathalos!
<string>Please, you have to save him!
<string>We will!
<string>Take Nata to camp.
<string>Got it.
