<string>Target sighted!
<string>Time to finish that request.
<string>En garde!
<string>Let's begin, then!
<string>You needn't worry about me!
<string>I still have fight in me!
<string>I have no excuse to offer...
<string>I've let you down...
<string>This can't be...!
<string>I shall make up for my mistakes!
<string>I've kept you waiting!
<string>I've laid down explosives.
<string>Explosives set and ready for detonation.
<string>Trap prepared.
<string>This trap will hold them...
<string>Any lingering effects?
<string>Seems that did the trick!
<string>Now, have at it!
<string>May this be of use!
<string>Flash deployed!
<string>Eyes down, deploying flash!
<string>Deploying a sonic bomb!
<string>I shall make use of a sonic bomb!
<string>Come to your senses!
<string>On your feet now, Hunter!
<string>You must hold on strong...!
<string>Discretion over valor, friend!
<string>Devil it all! We must fall back!
<string>You have my thanks.
<string>You have my gratitude!
<string>Most helpful!
<string>Ready to bring this to a close!
<string>It's not yet over. We must stay sharp.
<string>It's snared!
<string>Make use of this chance!
<string>The target is down!
<string>There's our chance!
<string>Leave this to me!
<string>I've mounted the beast!
<string>We've succeeded, thanks to your fine work.
<string>Superbly done.
<string>A most impressive display!
<string>I hope you'll have me along again.
<string>Thank goodness... And thank you, Hunter.
<string>That was...rather tough, no?
<string>Forgive me, I must retreat.
<string>I leave the rest to you.
<string>Firing a dung pod!
<string>Moving this one with a dung pod!
<string>We'll see it done!
<string>Weapons at the ready!
<string>Let's pursue!
<string>Commencing pursuit.
<string>I'm glad you weren't hurt.
<string>Another duty complete.
<string>It was an honor to join you, Hunter.
<string>This was educational, as always.
<string>Such a massive specimen...
<string>It's big... But we're prepared for anything.
<string>Quite small for its species, isn't it?
<string>It may be small, but we can't be careless!
<string>Localized break confirmed!
<string>That was a fine hit, Hunter!
<string>Let us make for the next target. I'm ready for<lf>immediate departure.
<string>Shall we prepare before pursuing the next target?
