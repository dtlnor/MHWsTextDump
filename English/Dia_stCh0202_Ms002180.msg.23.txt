<string>We'll find her. I promise.
<string>Come and speak to me once you're ready.<lf>I'm going with you.
<string>I need to prepare before leaving.
<string>Alma said she wanted to come along.
<string>Odds are, Maki headed for the monsters' nest.
<string>And where is that?
<string>Out the gate near the Bonefolk, then northeast,<lf>down the slope. It's a dead end.
<string>Traveler, if there's any way...<lf>If you can help her, <ITALIC>please.</ITALIC>
<string>Harnessing the heat of the Firespring to craft<lf>Oricalcite... That's the Firespring Festival.
<string>However, the quality of the Oricalcite hinges entirely<lf>on the integrity of the materials used to forge it.
<string>Dammit, Maki... How many times did I tell<lf>that girl to forget about the auric oil?
<string>Are you all right, traveler? You took off<lf>searching before you had a chance to rest...
<string>I'm fine, thank you.
<string>Good. You truly are a River in the Sands.
<string>It is what my village calls one whose heart brings<lf>happiness to others. A term of admiration.
<string>Tell me, traveler, might you have need of anything?
<string>As back in Kunafa, I am certain the people living<lf>here would be willing to barter for goods.
<string>All the more so if you offer them things from the<lf>forest or desert.
<string>Shall we begin the search?
<string>Let's go.
<string>(Speak about Azuz)
<string>(Open the Quest Board)
<string>I need a little more time.
<string>Right. Let's be on our way.
<string>I hope she hasn't run into any trouble...
<string>Stonefolk, Bonefolk, Oilfolk...<lf>And the Firespring, the Everforge...
<string>There's so much fascinating culture to absorb here.<lf>Can't you just picture this festival of theirs?
<string>Three clans, vying with each other since days of yore<lf>to create something incredible? I'd love to see that.
<string>First things first. We need to find the girl.
<string>Right... She might be in trouble if this region's<lf>"crawling with monsters this time of year."
<string>All the more reason to head out there prepared.
<string>Hunter, have you seen this village?<lf>It's amazing—all the different ways they do things.
<string>I mean, we had a few tricks up our<lf>sleeves where I came from, too...
<string>Like the way we raised fruits and vegetables...<lf>You should have seen it.
<string>While we're here, we should observe<lf>and learn as much as we can.
<string>Yeah!
