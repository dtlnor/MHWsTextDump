<string>Excuse me, Werner.<lf>Might we have a moment?
<string>Suppose you might.<lf>Sorry, who are you again?
<string>It's Alma. From Avis Unit?
<string>Uh-huh. OK. Don't remember.
<string>So? Shoot.
<string>Have you seen Olivia and Erik?
<string>What is Astrum Unit's mission?
<string>Tell us about your past work.
<string>(End Conversation)
<string>Have you seen Olivia and Erik? We have Seikret<lf>from Kunafa Village for them.
<string>Nope. Been a bit since I saw them.
<string>Did they leave to investigate the White Wraith, perhaps?
<string>Ah, right. They did tell me they were heading<lf>out. Something about a dam deep in the forest.
<string>What's Astrum Unit's primary mission here?<lf>Is it to look for the White Wraith?
<string>I heard that unlike other volunteers and referrals,<lf>you came to the Forbidden Lands on Guild orders.
<string>I suppose. But rescuing the Keepers is our main objective.
<string>At least, that's Olivia's. I've got something else<lf>I'm working on.
<string>Something else?
<string>The boy's pendant. My orders are to get<lf>to the bottom of it.
<string>Nobody can figure out what the hell it is.<lf>A complete enigma.
<string>But I'll tell you this: It's not just some little trinket.<lf>It's important. I just know it.
<string>Anyway, they say jump and I jump. They say go<lf>east and I go east. All there is to it.
<string>Hey, um! Think I could twist your arm into<lf>telling me how you came up with Wyvern's Fire?
<string>Didn't come up with it... Just the principle.
<string>Was too long ago for me to remember, anyway.
<string>You know you remember! C'mon, you gotta tell me!
<string>Wyvern's Fire basically mimics the way real wyverns<lf>condense and release energy, right?
<string>That tech is used everywhere! Wyvernblast,<lf>the Demolisher, and a whole buncha others!
<string>It's too amazing to just "forget."
<string>Shall we go deliver those two their Seikret?
<string>Can I come? Maybe we'll find the Wraith.
<string>I'll pass. I don't want to waste any more energy<lf>than I have to.
<string>The dam should be this way.

<string>What sort of traces did you find in the forest?
<string>There were marks on the ground.
<string>The Wraith was dragging something when<lf>it attacked our village.
<string>It smashed everything in sight...<lf>People were panicking...
<string>I could see it over my uncle's shoulder...<lf>This...horrible white THING...
<string>It's burned into my mind...
<string>The rain's really coming down...
<string>I can barely keep my eyes open.
<string>It's causing the water currents to surge, too.
<string>A downpour like this could have an effect on<lf>the monsters.
<string>We should all be extra careful.
<string>Yeah. Let's hurry.

<string>An SOS Flare!
<string>It's from the Astrum Unit!
<string>Let's go!
<string>The flare is coming from upstream!
<string>This is bad! Hurry!
<string>This is Astrum Unit we're talking about.
<string>It has to be a formidable monster if they're<lf>calling for help.
<string>The White Wraith? Or something else?
<string>It has to be the Wraith!
<string>Nata, if it is the White Wraith, it's crucial that<lf>you stay calm and observe.
<string>And to not leave the Seikret.
<string>I know.
<string>Monster engaged!<lf>The Guild authorizes you to repel this threat!
<string>Understood!
<string>Olivia, we have a Seikret!<lf>Can you ride?
<string>I learn fast!

<string>We need to drive it as far into the forest as we can.<lf>If it finds our Base Camp, we're in trouble.
<string>Right. Let's corner it.
<string>That veil protecting it is made of water and fluid.
<string>We either destroy the veil, or find a way to target<lf>its body directly.
<string>Love a challenge.
<string>Seikret, huh? Strong legs—and they're whip-smart too.
<string>Swell of you to bring me one.
<string>Keep your eyes peeled as we move.
<string>We'll drive it off.
<string>Well, Athos? Think you two can be furs of a feather?
<string>Fur sure.
<string>It's dangerous to wander off alone.
<string>Wait. Don't go off alone.
<string>It's likely a leviathan species... And one we've<lf>never seen back west, I'm certain.
<string>Quite the colorful creature, isn't it?
<string>Here I was, thinking this rain came on quickly.<lf>Next moment, it was a torrent. Then it was <ITALIC>that.</ITALIC>
<string>Plenty of monsters will appear alongside a change<lf>in the environment. This may be one of them.
<string>It wrapped the tendril-chains on its wings around<lf>its prey, then a flash of light.
<string>Whatever it did, it was fatal.<lf>Hmmm, this one's tough...
<string>The White Wraith... I was certain we would meet<lf>eventually, but that...
<string>What do you suppose the White Wraith did?
<string>Let's head back to Base Camp for now. Would you<lf>mind speaking with Olivia as well?
<string>That's the one. It looks just like<lf>it did back then.
<string>My village...
<string>...
<string>Your aid is appreciated. I thank you.
<string>It was a most impressive hunt. You have my respect.
<string>At last, we cross paths with the White Wraith. Am I the<lf>only one who trembles at the thought of this enigma?
<string>Do not mind me. I ask that you care for the boy.<lf>Please.
<string>What happen to forest lord? Stop moving?
<string>Waaagh... Lord...
<string>Lord. Graah.
<string>Shall we return to Base Camp for now?
<string>Yeah. Good idea.
<string>I need a little more time.
<string>Let's go.
<string>Another quick sweep of the area couldn't hurt.
<string>OK, let's review what we know.
<string>First, I think we can agree that the monster that<lf>crashed our hunt was indeed the White Wraith.
<string>We can also report that it did "something" to<lf>the leviathan that proved fatal.
<string>However, there were no traces of external trauma,<lf>which means...
<string>The White Wraith was somehow able to use<lf>a non-physical method of attack.
<string>Not troubling at all...
<string>...
<string>We should pay the Wudwuds a visit. Someone<lf>else might have seen our culprit.
<string>My unit will investigate here a bit longer.<lf>Good luck.
<string>You all right? Make sure you're prepared.
<string>You all right? Don't rush in when<lf>you're all frazzled.
<string>It's running circles around us... Do we need<lf>another equipment upgrade?
