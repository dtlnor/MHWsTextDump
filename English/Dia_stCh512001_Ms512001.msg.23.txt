<string>Hey, Hunter! I know it's out of the blue,<lf>but you wanna bust down a new door?
<string>I'm going to need some context here, Gemma.
<string>Right, so I was talking shop with some<lf>of the hunters from the other units earlier—
<string>...Hmm, I suppose I'm a function-first type?
<string>I do fuss over the little details,<lf>but even that's about practical things.
<string>It really depends on the weapons you're using.<lf>You can wind up stuck with one catch-all set.
<string>I hear ya. It's great to go all-in on one<lf>specific approach...
<string>But to survive out here, you've gotta be flexible.<lf>Try new things!
<string>Well, sure. But that's easier said than done.
<string>Why not start from looks, then? What do you<lf>say to a little friendly competition?
<string>Each unit comes up with a set of gear they want<lf>to put their hunter in.
<string>Hunters get the materials, we smithies craft,<lf>and then the big reveal!
<string>I call it, "Project Fashion Hunter:<lf>Busting Down the Door to Progress"!
<string>Oh, that's certainly one approach.<lf>Hmm, sounds like fun.
<string>It certainly could open new doors!
<string>It's true, changing up your gear can lead<lf>to some unexpected insights.
<string>Werner said I clearly had too much time<lf>on my hands...but he's down.
<string>Whichever unit gets the most votes wins.<lf>So, what do you think? You game?
<string>I'm in. We won't lose.
<string>Sorry, I'm a little busy right now...
<string>Ah hah! Just what I like to hear!
<string>Whoa, whoa.
<string>Whoaaa, whoa.
<string>Don't do me like that!
<string>C'mooon! You know I'm better than anyone<lf>at making a hunter shine!
<string>I've already got the whole fit planned.<lf>Here, just look.
<string>Bulaqchi Specs α<ICON EQUIP_TYPE2>
<string>Hope Mail α<ICON EQUIP_TYPE2>
<string>Clerk Vambraces α<ICON EQUIP_TYPE1>
<string>Chatacabra Coil α<ICON EQUIP_TYPE2>
<string>Piragill Greaves α<ICON EQUIP_TYPE2>
<string>All ya gotta do is equip this set as layered<lf>armor, and come show me.
<string>If there's anything you're lacking,<lf>you know I'm happy to make it.
<string>It's been some time since I've had such a thrill; like<lf>I'm able to breathe freely again.
<string>Perhaps a new door will open...
<string>Melchior and I, we're the best. We always win.
<string>You, Gemma, Enrai, and Werner... You're all<lf>pretty impressive, too. I bet you always win.
<string>So, we've got nothing but winners here, huh?
<string>Just between us, what are you gonna wear?<lf>Not telling, huh? That tracks.
<string>Do we really have nothing better to do?
<string>All I need to do is make sure Olivia leaves<lf>an impression. Should be easy enough.
<string>I'm so bored. I've nothing to do!
<string>I've been waiting for this! And... I guess<lf>I'll keep waiting. What're you wearing?
<string>The set I drafted up for you is:<lf>Bulaqchi Specs α<ICON EQUIP_TYPE2>,
<string>Hope Mail α<ICON EQUIP_TYPE2>, and Clerk Vambraces α<ICON EQUIP_TYPE1>.
<string>A Chatacabra Coil α<ICON EQUIP_TYPE2>, and some Piragill Greaves α<ICON EQUIP_TYPE2>.
<string>Go get those on—layered armor, remember!<lf>I'm telling you, you're gonna look amazing!
<string>Whoa... Hunter. You're looking good. Really good!
<string>It suits you even better than I thought.<lf>You got me feeling things here.
<string>Now, if you'll let me make just a couple little<lf>color tweaks with some quick dye...
<string>Perfect! Let's round everybody up and show you off!
<string>Esteemed colleagues, one and all, thank you for<lf>assembling on this most auspicious of days.
<string>The inaugural inter-unit Project Fashion Hunter<lf>face-off is officially in session!
<string>First up, from Turris Unit: Alessa!
<string>She was styled by Turris Unit's Enrai. Enrai says,<lf>"I wanted to showcase her kindness, positivity, and grace."
<string>A new door really has opened!
<string>Crisp and clean... I could never sell that sort<lf>of refinement.
<string>Love that combination! I never saw this one coming.
<string>Next up is Rosso, repping Rubrum Unit!
<string>He's dressed by Rubrum Unit's Melchior!<lf>"Red is Rosso's soul. It would be criminal not to use it."
<string>A natural match, eh? It's almost TOO perfect.
<string>How powerful. Really accentuates his unique charm.
<string>It's like he was born to wear this!
<string>Coming up next, my very own Avis Unit!
<string>Coordinated by yours truly, Gemma! Feast your eyes<lf>on a hunter fit to pluck a Rath from the skies!
<string>Gathering the materials was a pain.
<string>Hey, c'mon! They don't need to know that!
<string>Hold up, this one's coming in hot!
<string>Not bad at all, Hunter. A glimpse at an unexpected<lf>side of you.
<string>Next is Astrum Unit's very own Olivia!
<string>Wearing gear picked by Werner! His statement:<lf>"It's just her own beauty, as-is. Is that a problem?"
<string>Right... Here I am.
<string>Wow...
<string>Ooh...
<string>Ahh...
<string>Rgh, Werner!
<string>Anyway... Everyone, it's time to cast your vote!
<string>Whew, that was a blast, Hunter. Shame about<lf>the result, though.
<string>I never even thought to combine those pieces like<lf>that! It's been educational.
<string>For what it's worth, I thought your selection was<lf>pretty stunning too.
<string>Yeah? I thought so too!
<string>Since getting here, the only thing on my mind<lf>has been how to keep you guys alive.
<string>This little event brought me back to the old days,<lf>when I was just doing it for the thrill of creating.
<string>So I decided to just have fun with it,<lf>which got me this!
<string>This jacket's an important piece to me.<lf>It's what started it all.
<string>We'll call it a prize for MY winner. Take it.
<string>Thank you. I'll wear it with pride.
<string>Let's break more doors together sometime, Hunter.
<string>How's this layered armor?
