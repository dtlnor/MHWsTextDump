<string>Ever since coming here, it's been one dazzling<lf>new sight after another.
<string>I'm starting to think I should look into some<lf>tinted spectacles.
<string>Gemma's said as much, but everything here seems<lf>to happen on an unfathomable scale.
<string>Even monsters that wouldn't normally form packs back<lf>west will do so here.
<string>Sudden, periodic changes in the weather that<lf>happen again and again...
<string>Hmm, a reproducible cycle...
<string>This mission of ours is turning out to be more<lf>consequential than we thought.
<string>I know as well as anyone that there's no such thing<lf>as a world where all living creatures get along.
<string>Life is sustained by the consumption of other life.<lf>It's just how we're made.
<string>It's the root of life.
<string>I don't really get homesick. The thought hadn't<lf>even crossed my mind.
<string>I've never seen the skies open with so little<lf>warning. There isn't a hint of rain in the clouds.
<string>As I was hastening to put a pause to my studies—<lf>that's when the leviathan crept up on me.
<string>It makes me shudder to think what would have<lf>happened if you hadn't come along.
<string>It's quite clear from its actions that the<lf>White Wraith is absorbing elemental energy.
<string>The Downpour, the Sandtide—both were phenomena<lf>involving great elemental force.
<string>The question is, <ITALIC>why</ITALIC> absorb it? It didn't appear<lf>to be wounded.
<string>Werner? I think he's...<lf>Actually, I'm not sure where he went.
<string>We'll soon be heading for the Iceshard Cliffs<lf>to set up a Base Camp.
<string>Heh, you should have heard Werner gripe about it.
<string>But don't you worry. In between all the<lf>complaining, he always does a bang-up job.
<string>Huh? What is it?
<string>Oh! We cleared that path that was<lf>blocked by the snowstorm.
<string>Werner took care of it. One thing about him—<lf>he can never say no to Olivia.
<string>...What? I helped too!
<string>There's an old saying: to find exotic life,<lf>look for exotic circumstances.
<string>And being made artificially is as exotic<lf>a circumstance as any I can think of.
<string>In the end, it's still a living thing...
<string>There's no time for boredom here. Especially with<lf>Olivia letting me run wild, the saint.
<string>I'm sure the two of them had things they wanted to<lf>look into on their own anyway.
<string>So, where shall we start today?
<string>Care to make the trek out to the dam? Check in on<lf>the Wudwuds along the way?
<string>So much of the ecology has changed, even in the<lf>short while we've been here.
<string>There's really no telling what can happen.
<string>I wonder how Werner's doing. I just hope he isn't<lf>too up in his own head.
<string>Oh, hi. Didn't know you were coming by. Things are<lf>going swimmingly on my end.
<string>It's just as I thought—the forest is a perfect<lf>place to observe the Dragontorch's effects.
<string>Much as I'd like to take a little day trip now<lf>and then, I think I'll be stuck here for awhile.
<string>A message came in from Olivia. She says she wants<lf>to run something by you.
<string>I heard about the Dragontorch.<lf>Excessive energy discharge, right?
<string>They really can't catch a break<lf>over there, can they?
<string>Hmmm, what a mystery. I'm baffled. And I love it.
<string>If the energy deluge in their report is happening,<lf>we would expect a nonstop Downpour here.
<string>But that's observably not the case. Could it be a<lf>region-specific anomaly, or...? Hmm.
<string>We're fortunate to have Professor Fabius himself<lf>on the case.
<string>I don't think anyone has a deeper history with<lf>Gore Magala. Let's leave him to it and move on.
<string>The anomalous Inclemency, the monsters' strange<lf>behavior, and... Hmm, we're still short on data.
<string>Have you heard? Professor Fabius is back<lf>at Base Camp.
<string>He's apparently waiting for us at the Iceshard<lf>Cliffs. I was just headed there now.
<string>Rove hasn't shown any lingering symptoms. Seems<lf>like he's back to his usual self.
<string>That wouldn't be the case if not for the existing<lf>research and everyone's help.
<string>It must have been so much harder for the pioneers<lf>first tackling this... Fabius must be one of them.
<string>Busy times are coming. We're starting to grasp<lf>the fundamental structure of the Dragontorch.
<string>The possibility was always there. The Guardians are<lf>proof of Wyveria's bioengineering capabilities.
<string>And to fuel them all, a wellspring of energy,<lf>feeding each region... The flame of life itself.
<string>But at the same time, my doubts have only grown<lf>deeper. I... Well, I'll leave it there for now.
<string>I can't shake it... The image of Nata, desperately<lf>trying to help the people of Azuz.
<string>Shaking as he said he would stop the Dragontorch...
<string>I don't have the words to offer him.<lf>What could I say?
<string>Arkveld is no longer an extinct species. Being able<lf>to believe that fills me with joy.
<string>On a strictly personal level, that is. As a biologist,<lf>I'm still waiting to see.
<string>Coming here and being surrounded by life has made<lf>something clear to me. I'm just one person, alone.
<string>But it's also driven home that Olivia, Werner,<lf>and Athos are here, too.
<string>That's honestly been a real surprise for me.
<string>Where should we go once our investigation in the<lf>Forbidden Lands is finished?
<string>I never used to think about it ending, but lately,<lf>well... I suppose all things do?
<string>Maybe I'm just growing up a bit.
<string>Augh, there are too many places I want to go, too<lf>much I want to do. Life is so <ITALIC>busy!</ITALIC>
