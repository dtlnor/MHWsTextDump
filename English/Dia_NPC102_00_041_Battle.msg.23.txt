<string>Heh heh. Sorry to keep you waiting.
<string>You good?
<string>Thanks for calling on me.
<string>There it is.
<string>That's our target.
<string>Time to get to work!
<string>Don't hold anything back!
<string>Let's show everyone how it's done.
<string>Heh heh. I'm counting on you!
<string>How could I let this happen...?
<string>Sorry...about this...
<string>Sorry...Mentor...
<string>I gotta do better.
<string>Sorry to leave you hanging.
<string>Gotcha. A bomb it is.
<string>Bombs sure are heavy.
<string>I put a trap here!
<string>I got a trap here! Use it if you can!
<string>Hey, don't be so reckless.
<string>I know it's fun to play with fire,<lf>but take it easy, alright?
<string>Need this?
<string>Time to pull out all the stops, am I right?
<string>Want this? Heh heh.
<string>Flash incoming!
<string>Blinding the target!
<string>Using a sonic bomb!
<string>This should hurt its ears!
<string>Using a dung pod!
<string>A dung pod should get them running!
<string>I'll see if I can lure it into that trap.
<string>Be good and get caught in the trap for us, OK?
<string>You're not out for the count yet, right?
<string>This isn't a good place to take a nap.
<string>We should fall back and regroup!
<string>Oof, that's not good.
<string>Fall back! A nasty one's coming!
<string>It's gonna attack! Get ready!
<string>You can dodge this no problem, right?
<string>Better back off for now!
<string>Thanks. That's generous of you.
<string>Heh heh. Thanks.
<string>Thanks for keeping an eye out for me.
<string>We've almost got it.
<string>I think we both know how this is gonna end.
<string>Don't you lose focus now, OK?
<string>Got it!
<string>Time to work some magic!
<string>Time to go on the offensive!
<string>It's about to attack!
<string>Don't let that hit you!
<string>It's down. Now's our chance!
<string>Ready to work a little magic?
<string>No better time to go on the offensive.
<string>Show me what you got.
<string>They're fighting each other.<lf>What should we do?
<string>Ooh, a turf war. Scary!
<string>Heh... Stay still for me, OK?
<string>You behave now.
<string>Nice. You broke it.
<string>You've got good aim. I'm impressed.
<string>Looks like this is a job for me.
<string>I'll show it who's boss!
<string>That was a close one. Heh heh...
<string>Careful, Gemma will cry if you get hurt.
<string>The air's shifted. I think the environment<lf>is about to change.
<string>Something's different. I think we've got<lf>an environmental shift on our hands.
<string>I hear something. Bet we're in for a shift.
<string>I've got a feeling we've worn it down.
<string>My gut's saying it's losing steam.
<string>Aim for its legs. I bet we can bring it down.
<string>Look at its legs—the target's worn out.
<string>You hurt?
<string>I'll be able to see it no matter where it goes.
<string>Heh... Let's follow after it.
<string>This is a good time to gear up again.
<string>Whew... Glad that's done.
<string>Let's meet up again sometime.
<string>See you, Hunter.
<string>Heh heh. That was a good hunt.
<string>Gotta say, I enjoyed that one. How about you?
<string>Hope we cross paths again.
<string>See you, Ace Hunter.
<string>You know what? You're pretty good.
<string>Made it just in time!
<string>I was worried for a second there.
<string>I'm ducking out. See you.
<string>Goodbye and good luck.
<string>Ha... You don't look the least bit tired.
<string>Why don't we double-check our supplies?
<string>You call on me personally? Thanks.
<string>You sure you want me along? Heh heh.
