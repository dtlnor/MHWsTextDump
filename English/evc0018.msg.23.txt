<string>Elder!
<string>Thank the winds you've returned!
<string>I heard what you've done for us.
<string>And now the Doshaguma have moved on...
<string>Our livestock are unharmed...
<string>Our homes, saved.
<string>Yes, but...
<string>What was broken can be mended.
<string>What truly matters is that the great season<lf>of Plenty has arrived...
<string>And we can share in it together.
<string>At times, we don't have all the answers<lf>we think we do.
<string>But I hope you will accept our heartfelt<lf>gratitude.
<string>Thank you.
<string>Is there anything we can offer you in return?
<string>Well, we belong to an organization known<lf>as the Hunter's Guild.
<string>As you are aware, my friends and I are on an<lf>expedition to find the village of the Keepers.
<string>We would be grateful if you would allow us to speak<lf>to the people here and gather information.
<string>Ah, of course. Our gates will remain open to you.
<string>Visit any time, day or night.
<string>Elder.
<string>I believe it would be fitting to lend their comrades<lf>more of our Seikret.
<string>Why, that's a fine idea.
<string>May they aid you in your journey.
<string>I'm so happy you're all safe!
<string>Oh, I'm so glad to see you. We've been worried<lf>about you since you left.
<string>See? Told ya they'd be fine.
<string>You saved me... I can't thank you enough.
