<string>Kanya of Rubrum Unit reached out. The note says,<lf>"Wanna drop a line? I have a request for you!".
<string>Why don't we go pay her a visit?
<string>Oh, right. Kanya of the Rubrum Unit said she had<lf>something to discuss.
<string>Shall we go pay her a visit?
<string>Have you been angling, fisherfellow?<lf>Actually, lemme reel it in.
<string>Listen, could you and Alma help me? Seeing as you<lf>two are fellows with the Wudwuds.
<string>What is it, fisherfellow?
<string>I've got a day of fishing planned...
<string>See, I knew I could count on you!
<string><COLOR FF0000>#Rejected#</COLOR> Dia_stCh7100_Ms700010_0030_t011a
<string>Really? That's great! And disappointing.<lf>Greatappointing...
<string>Oh! Sounds like I'd better let Alma sub in.<lf>If you need me again, just say the word.
<string>The thing is, my fisherwuddler, Mastangler—
<string>OK, I think someone needs to set a limit on<lf>you smashing words together.
<string>We can discuss it later...
<string>I know Mastangler. Quite a reserved Wudwud,<lf>always out fishing?
<string>He and I hit it off from the moment we met.<lf>We're best angling buddies!
<string>But lately, his stomach's been doing the talking<lf>for him. I hear it growling all the time.
<string>My specialties lie in the water, but as<lf>a scholar... Something seems up.
<string>Fish are a central part of the Wudwuds' diet.
<string>So if a Wudwud is going hungry when he's<lf>living that close to a fishing spot, well...
<string>Something must be keeping them from getting food.
<string>Yes, and that "something" could be a monster.
<string>Yeah. That's why I was hoping you could accompany<lf>me to his fishing spot to check it out.
<string>If it's you guys, the Wudwuds are a lot less<lf>likely to freak out.
<string>Alright. Well, what are we waiting for?
<string>I'll show you the way!
<string>Thanks, Kanya!
<string>If you don't mind me asking, how do you<lf>communicate with Mastangler if he doesn't talk?
<string>When two people drop a line side-by-side, that's<lf>all you need. Any true fisher knows the feeling.
<string>Angling transcends words.
<string>Wow, you're a reel purrfessional!
<string>Any ideas which monster it could be?
<string>I had my zenny on a Bashaguma, but something<lf>isn't adding up.
<string>Bashaguma are a pillar of the Scarlet Forest's<lf>ecosystem, right?
<string>So if they're just out there doing their thing,<lf>that shouldn't result in a fish shortage.
<string>I see... A Doshaguma.
<string>Ooooh! Yes, that! I can't remember the name<lf>of anything out of the water, haha!
<string>Yep, a reel purrfessional...
<string>Mastangler should be at his fishing spot<lf>around now.
<string>He's been fishing around the clock to try and<lf>help his people.
<string>We should hurry, then. If the monster comes<lf>while he's alone...
<string>Yikes! Yeah, that would be bad.
<string>Oh! We're nearly there!
<string>Look!
<string>Don't touch that flaming bubble.
<string>Our target is a Mizutsune, a leviathan that<lf>feeds primarily on fish.
<string>Allowing it to roam free will lead to the gradual<lf>decimation of the Wudwuds' food supply.
<string>We should resume the hunt as soon as you<lf>feel prepared.
<string>Are you all right?
<string>We need to ensure the Wudwuds' safety, so I<lf>officially filed the Mizutsune quest with the Guild.
<string>Prepare and accept the quest when you're ready.
<string>So in the end it wasn't a greedy Bashaguma<lf>eating up all the fish after all.
<string>I bet it was still plenty hungry though!
<string>...scary.<lf>But...frens...hungry...
<string>Must...fish...sparklies...
<string>Well done! Mizutsune certainly don't go down easy.
<string>Everyone's waiting at Base Camp.<lf>Let's head back.
<string>Thank you so much for taking care of the Mizutsune!
<string>Now the Wudwuds' fishing spot will be safe<lf>and that means they'll be able to eat.
<string>......
<string>...fisherfellow, BIG like!
<string>I guess the Scarlet Forest's monster ecology<lf>is even more diverse than we thought.
<string>I'll be sure to make a note of that in my report<lf>about Mizutsune.
<string>We need to do more research on the ecological<lf>distribution here.
<string>I'm sure we can find a better way for the<lf>Mizutsune population and Wudwuds to coexist.
<string>Agreed. So now that this investigation is over,<lf>what should we do next...?
<string>Fishing!
<string>Sounds great to me.
