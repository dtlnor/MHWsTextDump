<string>Good Hunter, I bear glad tidings.
<string>The serenity you ushered in has opened<lf>the way back to our place of prayer.
<string>Apologies, but what is the place of prayer?
<string>A site where songs of prayer have been<lf>offered since ages past.
<string>It was rendered inaccessible after the downfall of<lf>Wyveria... But thanks to you, we have rebuilt.
<string>Having conferred with your comrades, the Allhearken<lf>has decided to make it a place of cultural exchange.
<string>I urge you to visit. You will find it on a path<lf>from the Peaks Back Gate.
<string>This is wonderful! To think a place of such rich<lf>history would become a Grand Hub!
<string>There are so many people! This is so exciting!
<string>It's a place for us to share our cultures—for East<lf>and West to take their first steps together.
<string>So many facilities! Let's go look around!
<string>Yeah, let's make the rounds.
<string>Amazing! I can't believe a place with such history<lf>has become a Grand Hub!
<string>A place where cultures can exchange ideas. Surely<lf>a step toward bringing East and West together.
