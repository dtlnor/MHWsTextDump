<string>We're almost there.
<string>This has been some journey, huh?
<string>Arkveld, the Guardians, the Dragontorch.<lf>And now...
<string>Wyveria's secret weapon.
<string>I miss napping on the sandship deck.
<string>That pack of Balahara was terrifying.
<string>Poor Nona really had a scare.
<string>You were so cool, though.
<string>I was afraid of you at first.
<string>Could I really trust a stranger who could cut down<lf>monsters like that to get me home?
<string>I really knew nothing then.
<string>I didn't know that sand could be as thick as fog.
<string>I'd never seen someone laugh like Nona during<lf>the season of Plenty.
<string>I'm sorry for not listening when we found Rey Dau.
<string>The red water, treeplegangers!
<string>The Firespring was so exciting!
<string>Humans, Wudwuds, monsters—<lf>we're just trying our best.
<string>The Guardians, too. Especially them.
<string>Before meeting you all...
<string>I really didn't know anything.
<string>Nata...
<string>It's time the Keepers see their mission through.
<string>Won't take much to wake it up.
<string>The Dragontorch.
<string>To think that little pendant can stop it.
<string>We don't have to do this.
<string>There's...one other option.
<string>Hunter...
<string>Are you sure?
<string>Right. It's worth a shot, isn't it?
<string>Yeah, let's do it!
<string>Leave this to me.
<string>Watch, Nata...
<string>This is what hunters do.
<string>I will!
<string>By my own order...
<string>I will slay Zoh Shia!
