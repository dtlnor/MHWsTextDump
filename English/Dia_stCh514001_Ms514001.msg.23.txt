<string>Nadia, pleeease?
<string>I really don't know...
<string>Aren't you investigating the Frenzy too?<lf>We should go together!
<string>As exhausted as you are?<lf>Nope. Not gonna happen.
<string>Oh, good, backup has arrived.
<string>So. You agree with me, right?
<string>Huh? Oh, uh...yes.
<string>There. See?
<string>Well, I've got stuff to attend to. See ya.
<string>Something wrong, Mina?
<string>Yeah. The number of powerful frenzied monsters<lf>is on the rise... Haven't you noticed?
<string>I've barely slept because I've had to run around<lf>hunting them and collecting their samples.
<string>And I tried to invite Nadia along when<lf>I saw her in the Cliffs...
<string>I mean, it's not often you get to rope a<lf>bona fide hero into your investigation!
<string>What's this "stuff" she's busy with?
<string>No idea.
<string>After the clash with Gogmazios,<lf>I really thought she and I had broken the ice.
<string>Right, but maybe you do need some rest.
<string>What? C'mon, you both worry too much!
<string>Anyway, gotta run. If you feel like it, try and<lf>knock out some of those Vespae Unit quests!
<string>Mina was right. That Frenzied<lf>monster was tougher than usual.
<string>Nadia, I saw you at the cliffs again.<lf>I really think we should team up!
<string>Mina, this has to stop.<lf>You've got even more wounds than before.
<string>Oh please. They're just scratches!
<string>Mm-hmm...
<string>Hey, you know what? I'm starving.<lf>Can't work when you're hungry.
<string>I'd kill for some well-done steak.<lf>We can head out together after we fuel up.
<string>Really!? I'll go grill up some meat right now!<lf>How do you want it?
<string>No frills. A simple dash of salt and spices...
<string>Oh, and could you make mine medium rare?<lf>Maybe whip up some gravy with the juice?
<string>I'll take 256 of them.
<string>You fiend! OK, I'll need some time,<lf>but I'm up to the challenge!
<string>Woo-hoo!
<string>OK, while she's grilling up the meat,<lf>I think I'll go for a little walk.
<string>Oh, are you taking a walk, too?
<string>...Yes. I was thinking I'd take a "walk" and then report in.
<string>The Iceshard Cliffs have some lovely trails.<lf>See you around.
<string>Maybe I should take a "walk" to the Iceshard Cliffs.
<string>I can't believe I get to go hunting with a bona fide hero!<lf>I'm gonna cook up 256 bad boys!
<string>Never underestimate the amount of meat<lf>our members can wolf down.
<string>All year 'round, from sunup to sundown,<lf>it's meat, meat, meat!
<string>There you are. I trust you know what's going on?
<string>I do. It's Gore Magala.
<string>Correct. What do you think?
<string>Since we both just happen to be here,<lf>I'd like to hear your thoughts.
<string>Why are Frenzied monsters on the rise?
<string>Why won't you take Mina along?
<string>(End Conversation)
<string>There's only one explanation for this<lf>sudden surge in Frenzied monsters.
<string>A Gore Magala. And a rather powerful one at that.
<string>Looks like we're on the same page then.
<string>A powerful specimen like this has a higher survival<lf>rate and can influence a much larger area.
<string>As a result, more monsters can become infected.
<string>Not only that, a Gore of this caliber carries<lf>a more potent strain of Frenzy.
<string>Which would likely explain the appearance<lf>of more ferocious Frenzied monsters.
<string>Well, guess I'll see if those steaks are ready...
<string>We both know you're not going anywhere.
<string>Oh, do we?
<string>So, why didn't you want to take Mina along?
<string>You have to ask?<lf>Don't you know her old nickname?
<string>"Bloody Mina." I can't let her do this hunt.
<string>Girls like her go in trying to be heroes.<lf>And in the end, die heroes...
<string>Even half-torn apart, they run headfirst into danger.
<string>Some people are like that.<lf>They have to be steered away from the shadows.
<string>I know a few of them myself: upright folks<lf>with...unswayable conviction.
<string>Confidence gets them in over their heads,<lf>and they end up not making it back.
<string>Like heroes from a storybook, y'know?<lf>They're fools. But what glorious fools.
<string>I certainly don't look down on them.
<string>But I'm tired of them being ripped out of our<lf>lives that way. No goodbyes. Only tears.
<string>I've prepared a quest to slay the Gore Magala.
<string>We'll do this one together.<lf>Take the quest when you're ready.
<string>Once we eliminate the cause, the increase<lf>in Frenzied monsters should abate.
<string>I noticed you've got no qualms with me coming along.
<string>Should I? You have a reason to<lf>come back from this, right?
<string>Now, if you're ready...<lf>We're going to do this ourselves.
<string>Otherwise, all that'll remain is a "goodbye"<lf>that we'll never hear again.
<string>Let's get going. There's no time for farewells now.
<string>You've got this down pat.<lf>Not that I'm surprised.
<string>Here it comes. Attack the head to put a stop to it!
<string>But you already knew that.
<string>It's targeting you. Think you can you ride it out?
<string>They're always the scariest on their last legs.<lf>Sends a chill up my spine...
<string>What do you mean? You finished up the Frenzy<lf>investigation while I was grilling?
<string>Well, actually, Avis Unit's superstar Hunter here took care of it.
<string>Huh? Oh, well... The job sort of fell into my lap.
<string>Aw, I made all these steaks!<lf>Now what do I do?
<string>We'll enjoy them together. You need to get your<lf>energy back up, and THEN...we can talk about hunting.
<string>I heal up fast! Just watch me!
<string>I'm gonna go run some laps to<lf>work up an appetite! Woo-HOO!
<string>That should be enough to keep even Killer Bee<lf>out of trouble for a while.
<string>Or maybe not, based on your expression.<lf>Girl's a real handful.
<string>What's wrong? You eating or not?<lf>You look like you want to ask me something.
<string>Say, on the off chance, I don't make it back<lf>from one of these...
<string>What would the others think?<lf>What would you?
<string>Are you kidding? Wow.
<string>I suggest you go run that question by the people<lf>you care about if you're that curious.
<string>I bet you a thousand zenny they'll smack you silly<lf>for even entertaining the thought.
<string>Actually, forget the bet, 'cause it's a cold, hard fact.
<string>Don't ask me how I know. I just do.
<string>Now, go on home to the people who need you.<lf>That's the only goodbye we're doing today.
<string>Huh...? How many did I just grill?
<string>One, two... Oh, whatever.<lf>It's not like me to sweat those kinda details anyway!
