<string>Insolent creature... I struggle to fathom why it clings to me.
<string>Pitiful creature, if you wish to prove your strength,<lf>hide not in my shadow, but fly through tempests.
<string>To endure the torments of nature is the path to true power.
<string>...Hmph.
<string>...Begone.
<string>As you can see, my options for movement<lf>are quite limited at the moment.
<string>For one to so boldly approach me, showing no fear...<lf>This creature is more brave than most fighters.
<string>A true beast is forged from the trials of nature.
<string>The only thing for you here is a life of mundane servitude.<lf>So begone, winged one! Fly free from this cage!
<string>...Hmph.
<string>So, you've resolved to come back and face me, have you?<lf>As you wish, we shall fight to the death!
<string>...Though, now is not a good time.
<string>The life that resists is worth reeling in.
<string>Both sides steadfast in their determination,<lf>what else could this be called but a fight to the death?
<string>What is this "tribooty"? These animals<lf>speak in a tongue I do not understand.
<string>Tell them if they request my "tribooty" again,<lf>the only thing they will receive is my fists!
<string>Just like this single strand, I must devote myself to my path.
<string>I must make my body and soul one, my being a still pond<lf>containing infinite depth. That is the first step.
<string>My trek through the snow has brought<lf>unexpectedly amusing results.
<string>To share shelter and sustenance with<lf>such a creature... Amusing indeed.
<string>Bone-freezing blizzards light a fire in the soul. Hardship and<lf>willpower, two sides of the same coin. Such is a wanderer.
<string>That creature understands well.
<string>Though we walk diverging paths, the creatures that live<lf>in these lands are true warriors in their own right.
<string>The remnants of dreams long past...
<string>Ruination is brought about by one's own weakness.<lf>That much is undeniable, but...
<string>What a view...
<string>That form, like a fist rising to pierce<lf>the heavens... Magnificent.
<string>This insolent bird, perching upon me like I'm some tree...
<string>Well...I suppose I can turn a blind eye to such trifle.
<string>I feel powerful energy emanating from the bowels<lf>of this place... My fists hunger to seek the source.
<string>Nothing shall block my path forward.
<string>Tell me, for what purpose did you hide the truth<lf>of what lies beyond this point?
<string>...No, never mind. It doesn't matter.
<string>The only truth that matters is who is the stronger.
<string>So you're here... Hmph. Perhaps I should<lf>consider a venture across these lands.
