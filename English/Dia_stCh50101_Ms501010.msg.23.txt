<string>Hey, can we talk for a minute?
<string>Did something happen?
<string>I was just thinking about how I could be more<lf>useful. As a Palico, y'know?
<string>I was thinking about how I can use things we find<lf>here in the East to be better support for you.
<string>Like, say...finding an easier way to heal up with a<lf>Vigorwasp in the middle of a hunt!
<string>That would be extremely convenient, actually.
<string>Right? Right? And I think I know how to do it!
<string>I want to try it out, but I need help collecting a Vigorwasp.
<string>'Course. I'd be happy to.
<string>Awright! Then get out there and<lf>nab one with your capture net!
<string>Thanks for catching that Vigorwasp, partner.
<string>Sure. Was that all you needed?
<string>Should be! Just leave the rest to me.
<string>I'll call out a Vigorwasp when I get a paw free.<lf>Use it when you need it!
<string>Heh, now I'm more fired up than ever!
<string>Nice catch! As expected of my partner.<lf>Let me have a look when we return to camp!
