<string>I never expected to be sent to such an invaluable<lf>place after entering the Forbidden Lands.
<string>I went beyond shock and straight into trepidation.<lf>Is it really OK for someone of my caliber to be here?
<string>Well...I guess they wouldn't have sent me otherwise.
<string>So Samin and Dareel don't really come by?<lf>I see, I see...
<string>Guess that means I'm free to do things my way!
<string>The place of prayer, an area protected by nature...<lf>Come to think of it, Suja was protected the same way.
<string>It's not uncommon for Wyverians to live<lf>in places like this, even in the West.
<string>Is it possible that Wyverians' sense of smell<lf>developed to be able to lead us to such locations?
<string>I had no idea that a single voice<lf>could stir one's heart in such a way.
<string>It's as if the soul of Suja is washing over me.
<string>I'm a Wyverian, so I know full well<lf>how important that singer is.
<string>I've never experienced anything like this.<lf>It's so...mysterious.
