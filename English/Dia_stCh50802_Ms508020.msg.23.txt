<string>Your listenings are much required. Do you know<lf>of the botherous creature in these trees?
<string>White of fur and red of flower. Draw too near,<lf>and suffer a mighty betingling. Big dangerous.
<string>From that description, you mean a Lala Barina.
<string>When pink and red clash, the fur pays damagings.<lf>Most dislikeworthy.
<string>So the Lala Barina is giving you trouble because<lf>it's damaging Congalala pelts...?
<string>Pink fur is the biggest of splenditude.<lf>Many scarrings are not.
<string>But pink and red are most odd...<lf>Ferocitaciousness is much different.
<string>Wait, both of them are aberrant cases...? Though<lf>it's hard to know anything for sure just yet.
<string>Fur aside for the moment, that's a concerning bit<lf>of news. If they pose a danger, we'll handle it.
<string>Well said. I will give to your hands.<lf>Wins will be met with rewardings.
<string>You are reliablous as ever. The danger is past.<lf>The pink fur is safe.
<string>Should be. The Lala Barina and Congalala were<lf>both what we call tempered monsters.
<string>They would have harmed the other life around here.<lf>I hope it was all right that we took care of them.
<string>There is no help. The pink temperous one was<lf>vicious. Worse, its fur had split ends. Scratchy.
<string>How...terrible. You're really serious<lf>about your fur, huh?
<string>You have my gratisfaction. We will help in return.<lf>Make offerings of finest Wudwud goods.
<string>Many more thankings to come, I am sure. We will do<lf>many dealings yet.
